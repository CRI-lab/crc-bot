ISSN 0749-0208\\n\\nA well-preserved, vertically stacked succession of two genetically distinct eolianites and associated caliche paleosol units, capped by modern and Holocene coastal dunes, occurs at Kaiehu Point, west Molokai, Hawaii. The Pleistocene eolianite facies comprise well-cemented, medium-grained skeletal carbonate sand and their morphostratigraphic evidence implies formation at times of lower than present sea level. Amino acid racemization (AAR) evidence suggests that the Lower Eolianite formed in OIS 5c and the Middle Eolianite during 5a with their superposed caliche paleosols having formed in subsequent stadial stages. The unconsolidated coastal sand dunes of Holocene age contain reworked Late Pleistocene skeletal carbonate sand based on AAR evidence. The most likely source of the reworked carbonate is from the erosion of the eolianites at Kaiehu Point. The Pleistocene eolianite-caliche paleosol sediments reveal variable Mg-content, stable isotope ratios and petrological characteristics consistent with changing degrees of weathering intensity and meteoric diagenesis. Accordingly, a two-phase model is favored for the formation of the eolianite-paleosol successions at Kaiehu Point, west Molokai. Eolianite sedimentation is initiated at times of marginally lower sea levels promoting the landward migration of bioclastic sand to form extensive eolian sandsheets. This is followed by a more pronounced phase of pedogenesis associated with a further fall in sea level and concomitant increased rainfall due to enhanced orographic effects.\\n\\nADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: Hawaii, Late Quaternary, Molokai, eolianite, carbonate lithofacies, amino acid racemization, stable isotopes, limestone petrology, caliche paleosols, sea level.\\n\\n### INTRODUCTION\\n\\nClimate is a major influence on the formation of eolianites and carbonate paleosols, and the two lithofacies have long been interpreted as sedimentary records of Pleistocene and Holocene climate history. In Hawaii, studies of carbonate eolianites and related paleosols were made by Harold Stearns on the island of Oahu and later at Kaiehu Point on Molokai. In subsequent papers, he refined his views of eolian deposition in light of changes in Hawaiian sea-level chronology. More recently, Hearty et al. surveyed last interglacial and Holocene carbonate deposits in Hawaii using amino acid racemization techniques and correlated eolian deposition with Marine Oxygen Isotope Substage 5e. However, the Hawaiian model of eolianite deposition proposed by Stearns largely relies upon lower sea levels to initiate dune formation, whereas the Bermudan and Bahamian models (e.g. Hearty and Vacher, 1994) are interpreted in the context of high sea-level stands. Because this difference calls into question important fundamental aspects of eolian deposition, the Hawaiian model is re-examined based on a study of the exposures at Kaiehu Point, Molokai, to improve our understanding of Hawaiian carbonate dune sequences and their relation to Quaternary sea-level history.\\n---\\n## MODELS OF EOLIANITE FORMATION\\n\\nIn view\\' of the significant differences in the published ori- the significant differences in the published ori- Stearns (1974) maintained that throughout the late Quater- Stearns (1974) maintained that throughout the late Quater-\\n\\ngins of Hawaiian STEARNS; 1970; 1974) and Bermudan Ba- nary, periods of low sea level represented the time when most nary, periods of low sea level represented the time when most\\n\\nhamian (BRETZ, 1960= LAVD et al, 1967= VACHER and HARMON, nary, periods of low sea level represented the time when most nary, periods of low sea level represented the time when most\\n\\n1987; HEARTY and KINDLER, 1995 eolianite paleosol of the now lithified dunes were deposited. of the now lithified dunes were deposited.\\n\\nthe contrasting depositional models are briefly reviewed the contrasting depositional models are briefly reviewed tes, when sea level is high, sand from beach is blown tes, when sea level is high, sand from a source beach is blown\\n\\nhere. here. inland by NE trade winds form active sand dunes land- inland by NE trade winds to form active sand dunes land-\\n\\n## Hawaiian Eolianite Model\\n\\nFive eolianite units have been identified on Oahu (Table from the beach, lithify, and develop soil profiles on their up- from the beach, lithify, and develop soil profiles on their up-\\n\\n1).

Bermuda depositional model.\\n---\\nLate Quaternary Eolianite\\n\\nLate Quaternary Eolianite 101\\n\\nResults\\n\\nEolianite Stratigraphy\\n\\nThe stratigraphy of the eolianite succession at Kaiehu Point comprises genetically distinct eolianite-caliche units, which in succession rest unconformably on beach rock. Upwards from the base of the exposure, occurs a basal calcarenite resembling beachrock. This is overlain by eolianite (approximately 1-2 m thick) termed here the Lower Eolianite, which is in turn capped by caliche (Lower Caliche: approximately 1-2 m thick). The succession of Holocene dunes, some 2-8 m thick, occur immediately above the upper caliche.\\n\\nLower Eolianite and Beach Rock\\n\\nThe Lower Eolianite, 1.5-2 m thick, well-indurated eolianite unit occurs at the western end of Kaiehu Point headland. The eolianite is moderately cemented, of medium grain size, and contains rhizoliths and well-developed cross-bedding. Stearns and MacDonald (1947) noted that exposures of a lithologically similar, well-indurated eolianite unit extend below sea level and preserve prominent benches. The mid-Holocene Kapapa Stand (+1-2 m; Fletcher and Jones, 1996; Grossman and Fletcher, 1998) and the last interglacial Waimanalo Stand (+2-6 m; Muhs and Szabo, 1994) were assigned to the eolianite unit as part of the Bellows Field Formation.\\n\\nThe calcrete and sand-rich facies of the lower caliche paleosol (below a laterally persistent brown silt) has aspects of an idealized caliche profile. The paleosol can be divided into repetitive sediment packages. Each package comprises a basal, red, medium- to fine-grained sand displaying variable degrees of generally light cementation, overlain by a white nodular calcrete crust that may be relatively thick (approximately 10-30 cm). Each sand/calcrete pattern is repeated four to six times within the paleosol below the middle eolianite.\\n\\nMiddle Eolianite and Paleosol\\n\\nUnconformably overlying the lower caliche is a 3 m thick, trough cross-bedded eolianite (Middle Eolianite). The steeper beds dip at 30 to 33 degrees. Calcareous grains are well-sorted and typically 0.5-1.0 mm in diameter and are moderately to well-cemented. Rhizoliths appear in the lower half of the unit and may relate to dune migration over a previously vegetated landscape at the time of lower caliche development. An abrupt unconformity at the base of the unit is characterized by a 3-5 cm thick calcrete crust (or hardpan).\\n\\nMineralogy and Mg Content\\n\\nTo assess the degree of sediment diagenesis at Kaiehu Point, X-ray diffraction analysis was undertaken. Percentages were quantified based on peak area measurements for aragonite, low- and high-magnesian calcite, as well as additional mineralogical components, using a Scintag XRD following standard methods. Although the relative percentages of calcite and aragonite are reported, in view of the very low concentration of accessory minerals, the relative percentages of the two major components are close to the total abundance in the sediment samples studied.\\n\\nPetrology and Stable Isotopes\\n\\nPetrologic and stable isotopic analyses were undertaken on samples from the section at Kaiehu Point. The isotopic composition of carbonate was determined by analysis of CO2 evolved by reaction of powdered samples with phosphoric acid at 50°C. Analytical uncertainty for isotopic analyses is less than ±0.1%. Isotopic compositions are reported in the standard δ-notation relative to VPDB. Terminology for describing microfabrics follows that of Rezak and Lavoie (1993).\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 42, 2005\\n---\\n## Fletcher 102 Fletcher et DL.\\n\\n- , . . - -\\n\\nI.:,;. i Holocene dle\\n\\n, -;,,\\n< ..>. -.:i,.:.;::\\\\\\n\\n,:- .\\n\\nHolocenedne , ~ I lcwcr Clichc upper cliche ,ne aune\\n\\nUDpC\\n\\ncaliche\\n\\nmiddlc\\n\\ncaann\\n\\ncaicrccc\\n\\nbrown silc\\n\\nbrown silt\\n\\nCaliche\\n\\ncwcr caliche\\n\\neolrnite\\n\\nFiure peach Kaiehu Foint;\\n\\n|Figure 5.|Eolianak succession at Kaiehu Point.

Coral fragments are rare. Although well washed and lacking detrital micrite, these rocks are rather poorly sorted with particle sizes typically ranging from medium to very coarse-grained sand (0.23 to 1.3 mm).|\\n\\nThe fabric of these rocks is largely cement-supported and the cements are dominated by three morphologies. One morphology is characterized by irregular coatings of micrite around grains that form meniscus cements and thin bridges of micrite between grains. Another is characterized by bladed calcite cements. The third cement morphology is characterized by a later void-filling drusy, sparry calcite that shows a coarsening of crystals towards the center of the pores, and that rounds pores but does not usually completely occlude them. Aragonite needle cements are not present.\\n\\n## Eolianite Lithofacies\\n\\nThe eolianite cements generally display a wide range of crystal sizes and shapes including finely crystalline anhedral spar and coarse blocky spar, as noted in eolian carbonates from other regions (e.g. Yucatan). Cementation of spar and microspar is patchy, and portions of the beds remain completely uncemented. Overgrowths on echinoderm fragments are partial and confined to areas with only small pores (where water was stuck due to capillary action) and cements are generally best concentrated along small pore throats and within small primary intraskeletal pores such as within foraminifer apertures. Occasional occurrences of vadose whisker crystals occur in the upper eolianite within voids of root molds.\\n\\nThe eolianites are massive to cross-bedded calcarenites that display a similar skeletal assemblage to the underlying beach rock, with the exception that they contain greater proportions of disk-shaped Amphisorus foraminifers, possibly related to selective sedimentation due to their aerodynamic properties. The majority of the skeletal grains in the eolianites are highly abraded and, in contrast to the rounded and poorly sorted nature of the beach rock grains, have subangular to subrounded grains and are well sorted. Meniscus microspar and sparry cements typical of vadose cementation occur in these units and they display carbon and oxygen isotope ratios characteristic of modern skeletal sands.\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nAge of the Eolianites\\n\\nThe AAR data for Periglypta reticulata appear to bracket the whole-rock data for the middle eolianite from Kaiehu Point, Molokai, suggesting a Late Pleistocene age for this unit. The whole-rock AAR results for the middle eolianite at Kaiehu Point also yield a lower degree of racemization than the whole-rock sample of last interglacial age from Barbers Point, Oahu. The middle eolianite at Kaiehu Point is most likely younger than the last interglacial maximum, and may correlate with a sub-stage marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 5 (OIS 5a-d ca. 82-116 ka).\\n\\nWarren (1983) attributed the formation of micritic grain coats such as found in the Kaiehu Point caliche units to fluctuations in the volume and salinity of films of water on grains that occur after gravitational water has drained from the pores and evapotranspiration has not yet begun. Warren suggested that, relative to the dune mass, a greater abundance of micrite is deposited within pedogenic calcretes as these are sites associated with the soil moisture zone that is the zone of maximum pore waters and pCO2 flux. Evaporation and soil moisture fluctuations likely control the formation of micritic grain coats in these environments.\\n\\nThe middle eolianite at Kaiehu Point, Molokai, also displays a similar extent of racemization to an eolianite at Kaena Point, Oahu, which directly overlies a last interglacial reef. Although some of the coralline bioclasts from the gravels overlying the in situ reef at Kaena Point have been dated as last interglacial, it is likely that a significant component of the eolianite sediment at Kaena Point is actually younger than the last interglacial maximum.\\n\\nReference: Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 42, 2005\\n---\\n## Fletcher\\n\\n|Sample|Description|Argonite|Gypsum|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Beach Sand| |High|Low|\\n|Dune Sand| |Medium|Low|\\n|Dune Sand| |Low|Low|\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Eolianite| | | |\\n|Rhizolith| | | |\\n|Concrete| | | |\\n|Brown Silt| | | |\\n|Red Sand| |Low| |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Red Sand| | | |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Red Sand| | | |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Red Sand| | | |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Red Sand| | | |\\n|Calcrete| | | |\\n|Eolianite| | | |\\n|Beachrock| | | |\\n\\nFigure 7.

This may indicate that the two eolianite-caliche successions are similar in age.\\n\\nAlthough the amino acid racemization method lacks the age resolving power to discriminate at the substage level within OIS, the results preclude the upper and lower caliches having formed in substantially different intervals of time of the Late Pleistocene.\\n\\n|Sample|Stable Isotopic Composition of Eolianite and Paleosol Sediments|S13C (PDB)|S18O (PDB)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Beach Sand| |0.89|-1.41|\\n|Beach Sand| |0.97|-1.32|\\n|Beach Sand| |0.99|-1.40|\\n|Dune Sand (active)| |0.99|-1.40|\\n|Dune Sand (lithified)| |1.19|0.44|\\n|Paleosol| |-1.43|-2.83|\\n|FAMnt| |0.90| |\\n|Eolianite| |0.90|-1.38|\\n|Eolianite| |0.57| |\\n|Rhizolith (calcrete)| |-2.12|-3.33|\\n|Hardpan| |0.93| |\\n|Calcrete| |1.03|-0.40|\\n|Calcrete| |0.92|-1.34|\\n|Red Sand| |-0.57|-2.06|\\n|Calcrete| |3.02| |\\n|Calcrete| |-3.25|-3.02|\\n|Calcrete| |1.00| |\\n|Red Sand| |0.73|2.07|\\n|Red Sand| |-0.73|-2.07|\\n|Calcrete| |4.08| |\\n|Calcrete| |-6.32|-4.08|\\n|Calcrete| |-7.12|-5.05|\\n|Calcrete| |2.63|-2.96|\\n|Red Sand| |1.62| |\\n|Calcrete| |3.84| |\\n|Calcrete| |-5.92|-3.84|\\n|Calcrete| |-2.63|-2.96|\\n|Red Sand| |1.08|-0.99|\\n|Beachrock| |0.6| |\\n|Beachrock| |0.78|-1.51|\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 42, 2005\\n---\\n## Late Quaternary Eolianite\\n\\nFigure Morphology rocks A-C.

In this region, it was found that reworking of skeletal carbonate sand accompanied each interglacial highstand, such that the residence time of skeletal carbonate sediment was on average 100 ka, a trend evident at least since the Early-Middle Pleistocene boundary.\\n\\nThe relative amounts of magnesian calcite determined in 16 of the Kaichu Point samples show a diagenetic trend. Generally, beach and unconsolidated dune sands have greater percentage of high-magnesian calcite over low-magnesian calcite, while soils and eolianites contain higher percentages of low-magnesian calcite. Soil samples 105, 106, 107, and 108 have relatively high percentages of low-magnesian calcite, an indication that aragonite and high-magnesian calcite has re-precipitated to low-magnesian calcite during meteoric diagenesis (FRIEDMAN, 1964).\\n\\nMedium-magnesian calcite is more abundant in the carbonates in the middle of the stratigraphic section than in the older or younger carbonates. Sample 4 has a medium-magnesian calcite composition. Evidently, intense weathering of the exposed middle eolianite altered its aragonite and high-magnesian calcite to medium-magnesian calcite soil, which characterizes the calcrete paleosol.\\n\\nWith the exception of sample 110 aragonite is missing entirely in the four lowermost calcrete horizons (samples 106, 108, 109, and 109: Figure 7), and in the rhizolith (sample 6) and brown soil (sample 103), gypsum and halite are the most abundant minerals.\\n\\nThe basal beachrock unit, the lowermost eolianite, and its overlying paleosol all contain surprisingly high amounts of\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 42, 2005\\n---\\n|Content|Page Number|\\n|---|---|\\n|Fletcher = 108 Fletcher et QI| |\\n|Figure Anhedral spAT.

Beachrock at the base of the succession lithified when relative sea level was near present. A significant and rapid fall in sea level is inferred (Neumann and Heartt, 1996) associated with the formation of the succession of beachrock, eolianite, and lower caliche paleosol. Based on the similar degree of amino acid racemization within Carelia sinclairi from the upper caliche, middle eolianite, and lower caliche, the entire succession of lithified units at Kaiehu Point, excluding the unconsolidated Holocene sands, were deposited within a narrow range of time, and possibly during the last interglacial sensu lato (OIS 5a-d). Stirling et al. (1998) placed sea level during OIS 5d and 5h between -25 and -55 m, for locations in Bermuda, the Bahamas, and Western Australia. Importantly, the insular shelf of Molokai (and Oahu) is composed of OIS 7 paleoreef complex (Sherman et al., 1999) with a sharp increase in slope, a seaward-facing wall (Fletcher and Sherman, 1995) that begins at approximately -20 m. If sea level drops below the lip of this feature, it would constitute a significant interruption in the carbonate sediment availability to landward calcarenites. The dune field at Kaiehu Point would consequently become sediment-starved, and weathering and lithification would ensue under an accelerated pace associated with the enhanced orographic circulation.\\n\\nChange in Orography and Climatic Conditions on the Islands\\n\\nAlthough glacial periods represent times of enhanced global aridity, lower sea levels have indirectly increased rainfall on the Hawaiian Islands, owing to the orographic effect. When moist northeasterly tradewinds approach the highlands, the air is forced to rise and cool. Clouds form and create a rainy environment on the slopes below. Gavenda (1992) proposed that lowering sea level by 100 m could potentially double the rainfall on Molokai. When sea level attains present levels, the orographic effect on the west Molokai Plateau is slight, and the microclimate remains. The δ18O of groundwater in Hawaii is largely a function of the orographic effect and to a lesser extent the intensity of the tradewinds and storms (Scholl et al., 1996). Enhanced weathering during rainy periods associated with lower sea levels is reflected in the significantly lower δ18O values of the caliche paleosols at Kaiehu Point. The lower caliche at Kaiehu Point is characterized by a series of four to six sedimentary packages, each including a lower red sand unit grading into an upper calcrete layer. These packages are interpreted as representing renewed, but temporary, sand deposition associated with intermittent sand source availability due to either fluctuating sea levels and/or enhanced orographic circulation.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 42, 2005\\n---\\n## Fletcher et al\\n\\nactive dune migration during the OIS Ja-d period. The present day transport of sand from active dunes to stable ridges was by Stearns himself, where he attempted to name the stratigraphy at Kaiehu Point (STEARNS, 1973).\\n\\nWell inland of the beach, and the existence of the Desert Strip near Kaiehu Point both suggest that dunes on Molokai have been migratory, unlike those on Bermuda that are stable (BRETZ, 1960). This ultimately makes a direct comparison of Bermuda and Hawaii dune and soil formation less practical.\\n\\nLaterally persistent fluvial silt unconformably overlies the uppermost red sand of the caliche. It is fine-grained, contains some iron in the form of hematite, and has considerable amounts of halite, kaolinite, and gypsum. Hematite is derived from basalt weathering, kaolinite a product of intense chemical weathering, and gypsum of evaporitic origin during dry conditions (SCHOLLE et al, 1983).\\n\\nSTEARNS (1973) identified the basal eolianite unit at Kaiehu Point as the Bellows Field Formation and suggested that these sands extend below sea level. He did not recognize, however, the beachrock and breccia facies as it was below high tide at the time of his visit. Stearns assigned an Illinoian age of about 320 ka to this oldest eolian unit, and proposed that it was deposited when the sea was some 106 m below present level.\\n\\nGypsum and halite precipitation. Toward the end of silt deposition, then, the seas were rising again and the climate was becoming increasingly arid. A temigenous origin for the silt is favored based on the complete absence of marine skeletal fragments and its similar lithological properties to fluvial silt deposits in the immediate watershed.\\n\\nThe upper caliche, interpreted as having formed in a temperate and moist climate associated with the last glacial period, lacks the red sand characteristic of the lower caliche because sea levels were distinctly lower in OIS 4-2. This effectively shut off the carbonate sand source and all eolian deposition ceased.\\n\\nWith higher sea levels associated with OIS Ja-c, dune deposition at Kaiehu Point once again became active. The high gypsum rhizoliths within the middle eolianite indicate that the dunes must have stabilized and supported plant growth, consistent with a sea level that was relatively low, but in the process of rising.\\n\\nThe middle eolianite, upper caliche, and unconsolidated dunes were regarded as recent. On Oahu, STEARNS (1970) identified the Laniloa Formation of Oahu, and also blew inland when the sea was lower than present.\\n\\nBased on the evidence presented in this work, we favor the view that the entire succession at Kaiehu Point formed earlier, and during the fluctuating sea levels during OIS Ja-d.\\n\\nThe amino acid racemization results reported here point to a less complicated interpretation of the lithostratigraphy at Kaiehu Point, than originally proposed by STEARNS (1970).\\n\\nThe eolianite nomenclature formulated by STEARNS (1970) for Oahu provides a stratigraphic framework for all eolianite successions in Hawaii. Thus far, however, the only attempt to apply the stratigraphic nomenclature to neighboring islands...\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 42, 2005\\n---\\nLate Quaternary Eolianite\\n\\nLate Quaternary Eolianite significantly below present sea level. These features are all consistent with our observations at Kaiehu, with the exception of the basal beach rock unit. If the beach rock truly represents a sustained interval of near present sea level, then the rocks at Kaiehu Point may correlate with the Leahi age, correlative to OIS 5a-c. Stearns (1970) describes the Leahi eolianites on Oahu as resting on beach rock and representing a regressive sequence, much like the lowest eolianite at Kaiehu Point.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nA well-preserved, vertically stacked succession of two genetically distinct eolianites with associated caliche paleosol units at Kaiehu Point, west Molokai, is concluded to have formed during the later stages of OIS 5 based on AAR evidence. Although the AAR method lacks the age-resolving ability to definitively conclude in which substage each of the eolianite deposits formed, morphostratigraphic evidence would favor the Lower Eolianite having formed in OIS 5c and the Middle Eolianite during 5a with the superposed caliche paleosols for each unit having formed in subsequent stadial stages. This interpretation is favored in view of the thick and advanced stages of caliche paleosol development on each of the eolianite units, each representing several thousands of years of pedogenesis. Accordingly, the eolianite-caliche paleosol succession at Kaiehu Point, west Molokai, is a function of glacio-eustatic sea-level changes and local climatic changes.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nWe acknowledge funding for this research from the National Science Foundation, Division of Earth Sciences and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program, the Australian Research Council, and the State of Hawaii Department of Lands and Natural Resources.

Longshore sediment transport rates on a reef-fronted beach: field data and empirical models Kaanapali Beach, Hawaii. Journal of Coastal Research, 19(0), 000–000. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Longshore sediment transport (LST) measured at monthly beach profiles on Kaanapali Beach, Maui is compared to three predictive models. We observe cumulative net sediment transport rates of approximately 29,379 4400 m3/yr to the north and 22,358 1300 m3/yr to the south for summer and winter respectively. Kaanapali Beach experiences a net annual rate of 7,021 700 m3/yr to the north and a gross annual rate of 51,736 5100 m3/yr. Transport models, namely CERC (1984), CERC, 1991 (GENESIS) and KAMPHIUS (1991) predict net annual LST rates at 3 103 percent, 77 percent and 6 103 percent of the observed rates respectively. The success of the Genesis model is attributed to its ability to account for short-term changes in near-shore parameters. The use of CERC (1984) is prone to practical errors in its application including use of the recommended K coefficient and wave averaging that may significantly overestimate LST. The use of KAMPHIUS (1991) is more sensitive to beach slope and wave period than CERC (1984) and may over-predict transport on steep sloped beaches with high wave energy. Presence of fringing reef significantly affects the ability of LST models to accurately predict sediment transport. When applying CERC (1984, 1991) and KAMPHIUS (1991) formulas, functional beach profile area available for sediment transport is assumed much larger than actually exists in Kaanapali. None of the models evaluated account for the presence of a reef system. This may contribute to overestimations of LST as they assume the entire profile is mobile sediment. However, the fact that CERC (1991) underestimates the observed transport implies that environmental parameters employed in these models (such as wave height, direction and period) play a more substantial role than the influence of the reef in model results.\\n\\nADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: Longshore sediment transport, sediment transport modeling, fringing reef, beach profiles, coastal erosion, Hawaii, beaches.\\n\\n### INTRODUCTION\\n\\nMany coastal science and engineering studies attempt to predict rates of longshore and cross-shore sediment transport. The scope of predictive formulas are largely empirical and reflect results based on field studies from around the world (KOMAR and INMAN, 1970; DEAN, 1989; BODGE and KRAUS, 1991; KRAUS et al., 1991; SHORT, 1999). Researchers have found that sediment concentration and transport at the breaker line is strongly influenced by breaker type and thus wave energy (KANA and WARD, 1980; NIELSEN, 1984; VAN RIJN, 1993). Field techniques for measuring total and suspended longshore sediment transport include sediment tracer, impoundment and streamer traps. Here we employ the impoundment technique for comparison with three predictive longshore transport models.\\n\\nThe near-shore sediment transport system of Kaanapali Beach, Maui is examined using 13 monthly beach surveys.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL SETTING\\n\\nKaanapali Beach is located on the west coast of the island of Maui, Hawaii in the lee of the dominant northeast trade winds. Meteorological conditions of this coast are variable but typically calm with moderate trade winds and infrequent but strong onshore storm winds (Kona Storms). The surrounding islands shelter the area from most swells except for three pronounced swell windows. The southern swell window rang-\\n---\\n## Longshore Sediment Transport Rates on a Reef-Fronted Beach\\n\\n1C2 mi - Main Hawaiian Islands and Maui Swell Windows\\n\\n21 NI - 280 West Swells 350-360 0 8\\n\\n19 N Kaanapali Maui Nui Complex 260 220 J 180\\n\\n60 W 153 Wv\\n\\nFigure 1.

At approximately 500 m intervals, the fringing reef is broken by shore-normal channels (Aawa) that direct the flow of nearshore water and sediment seaward. The fringing reef constitutes a geologic framework that plays a significant role in the stability and replenishment of the beach system in this area. The southern portion of the study area is largely fronted by fringing fossil coral reef that restricts the sub-aqueous beach profile area actively involved in sediment transport and can be idealized as a perched beach atop a fossil reef. This shallow fringing reef truncates the surface area of the beach profile, reducing the total area that is available for sediment exchange and mobilization.\\n\\nThe area is exposed to an opposing bi-modal swell regime that subjects the beach system to seasonal wave forcing from opposite directions, while west swells rarely enter their respective swell window. North Pacific deep-water swells in the winter months can exceed 10 m in height with periods of up to 25 s. Similarly, south swells are commonly 1 to 3 m but can exceed 6 m in height with periods of up to 22 s ARMS-TRONG (1983). Kona storms are locally produced low-pressure systems that approach from the south or southwest. Kona storms can generate wave heights up of 3 to 5 m and periods of 8 to 14 s. Although these storms occur infrequently, they are the cause of extensive coastal damage to south and west facing shorelines (MAKAI OCEAN ENGINEERING, INC. and SEA ENGINEERING INC., 1991; ROONEY and FLETCHER, 2000).\\n\\nThe study area consists of a 4.6 km continuous carbonate beach that is bisected by a prominent basalt headland, Kekaa Point. Kekaa Point divides the area into two distinct littoral cells, the Honokowai cell to the north and the Kaanapali cell to the south with seasonal sediment impoundment occurring on both sides. The beach is composed of moderately-sorted carbonate sand with a minor basalt component (10 percent) and a median grain size diameter of 0.23 mm. The beach generally displays a steep foreshore slope (vertical: horizontal) mean 1:8, and a gentler backshore (sub-aerial) slope mean of 1:11. The foreshore slope was applied as input to the LST models described.\\n\\nShallow fringing reef (1 m depth) dominates the northern and southern extents of the study area with deeper outcrops of fossil reef (5–10 m depth) observed intermittently in the central area. The fringing reef is composed of fossil reefal limestone and beachrock that dominate the reef flat and shallow reef segments. Encrusting coralline algae and branching corals are found at deeper regions of the reef front forming.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 19, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\n## Eversole and Fletcher Cumulative Volume Change\\n\\n|Jaeel Charue|Summer AV-X[(VA|\\n|---|---|\\n|(A'awta)|Winter Volume|\\n|Kclai Point|Vai= Vol;7250 m|\\n|(Bhck Ract) HHonpkowa|Vas Vol +250 m|\\n|Kal Point|Vas Vol *250m|\\n|Sud Area|VAz Vol #250 m|\\n|Hanakoo|V45-Vol *250|\\n\\nNot to Scale\\n\\nFigure 2.

Thirteen monthly surveys were performed from March, 2000 to April, 2001. Beach profiles and volumes were measured using a Geodimeter total station and a 7 m telescoping rod with reflecting prism. Shore-normal profiles extended over the sub-aerial and sub-aqueous portions of the beach with measurements at approximately 2 m intervals or at each significant change in slope or bottom type. Surveys were conducted randomly with respect to tide and swell conditions and typically extended approximately 100 m offshore into water depths of 5 to 7 m.\\n\\n### Sediment-Reef Interface\\n\\nIn carrying out the surveys, continuous and patchy hard reef was encountered along many of the profiles in Kaanapali. The presence of a fringing reef significantly alters the profile by truncating that portion of the beach and creating a shallower than expected sand-reef interface, often referred to as the Depth of Closure (DOC). The first occurrence of hard substrate is considered the depth at which the profile is no longer adjusting to wave energy and hence operates as the prescriptive depth of closure (DOC). In Kaanapali, we find a shallow DOC where there is reef present and a deeper DOC where the profile remains sandy.\\n\\n### Cumulative Beach Volume\\n\\nBeach volumes are calculated as the volume under the profile extending from the landward edge of the subaerial beach to the first occurrence of submerged hard substrate often just seaward of the toe of the beach. The profiles extend from the landward edge of the dune system (where present) beyond the beach toe to the edge of the reef slope. We calculate the spatial cumulative beach volume alongshore based on each sectional volume (profile volume per alongshore unit of beach). The section volumes are in turn multiplied by the alongshore distance between each profile to account for the monthly volume change for each section of beach.\\n\\n### Uncertainty Analysis\\n\\nThree main sources of error are identified in the uncertainty analysis for profile area volume. Where: Volume Uncertainty (VU) = [(meander error)^2 + (basement error)^2 + (cross-shore error)^2]^1/2\\n\\nMeasurement error is considered negligible as the profiling\\n---\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n\\n## Monthly Beach Profiles\\n\\n|Profile 5|Profile 8|\\n|---|---|\\n|Mean Sea Level|Mean Sea Level|\\n|Horizontal Dist (m)|Horizontal Dist (m) Reef Surface|\\n| | |\\n|Profile 6|Profile 9|\\n|Mean Sea Level|Mean Sea Level Reef Surface|\\n|Horizontal Dist (m)|Horizontal Dist (m)|\\n| | |\\n\\nFigure 4.

Likewise, the landward margin of the profile is fixed and thus induces no uncertainty. Meander error (500 m3), is associated with variation in the seaward margin of the sub-aerial profile as observed in foreshore meanders at the shoreline. Meander error is calculated by taking the mean observed meander width (10 m) times the alongshore wavelength of the meander (50 m) times the profile area (1 m). Basement error (2 m 500 m 1 m 1000 m3), caused by variable relief of the basement strata, (which constitutes the lower boundary of the profile volume) is assumed to be horizontal landward from the first occurrence of hard basement. Cross-shore error (1120 m3), calculated from the seasonal profile net volume difference between profile 5 and 9, represents sediment lost\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 19, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\n## Longshore Sediment Transport Rates on a Reef-Fronted Beach Mean Profile Volume\\n\\n| |Profile Location|\\n|---|---|\\n|800|652|685|\\n|700| |\\n|600| |\\n|500|397|\\n|400|318|283|\\n|300|186|\\n|200|118|126|\\n|100|10|\\n\\nFigure 5.

Using the additive error process described above, volume uncertainty for observed net annual volume change is estimated to be 1100 m3/month and is reported as the mean percentage of each monthly cumulative volume.\\n\\nThe CERC (1991) model calculates longshore transport on a modeled cell by cell (20 m cell) basis alongshore which allows the user to estimate transport at any point along the study area after a given computational run is completed.\\n\\nNone of the models utilized in this study account for hard substrate such as a fringing reef, and each model assumes the entire study area is transportable sediment.\\n\\nLongshore transport observations were carried out in the southern (Kaanapali) area for the section of beach between profile numbers 5 and 9. This section of beach exhibits the highest longshore transport rate and represents the most dynamic portion of the beach system. The average observed cumulative annual net volume change at profile 7 is compared to the predicted cumulative volume change from the Genesis model.\\n\\n## Longshore Transport Models\\n\\nSediment transport modeling was carried out using three LST formulas: (CERC, 1984; KAMPHIUS, 1991; and the GENESIS model (CERC, 1991). Each of these models utilizes different environmental input parameters including; wave height, period, direction, sand size, sand porosity, beach slope, sand and water density, wave breaker index and empirical coefficients. The CERC (1991) model employs the most detailed environmental parameters including the nearshore bathymetry and antecedent conditions in a cumulative time-series of calculations rather than a snapshot calculation of given conditions as the CERC (1984) and KAMPHIUS (1991) models.\\n\\n## Beach Volume Net Change from Mean by Month\\n\\n| |May|Aug|Sept|Oct|Nov|Dec|Feb|Mar|April|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Mar|June|July| | |Jan| | | |\\n\\nFigure 6.

Profile 7 was selected as a common location for comparative analysis of observations to models and exhibits an inflection or hinge point in the trend of the data. Results indicate the Genesis prediction closely approximates the observed net annual transport at profile 7.\\n\\nSeasonal Beach Volume Change\\n\\nSurveyed beach profiles at Kaanapali reveal a clear cyclic pattern of erosion and accretion due to seasonal wave forcing. While the profile volumes are highly variable alongshore we see that the mean volume, volume range and net volume are\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 19, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\n## Longshore Sediment Transport Rates on a Reef-Fronted Beach\\n\\n|Profile|Observed Depth of Closure (m)|Hallermeier Prediction|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|1|0.70|7.54|\\n|2|1.80|7.54|\\n|3|2.10|7.54|\\n|4|8.00|7.54|\\n|5|6.00|7.54|\\n|6|6.00|7.54|\\n|7|3.00|7.54|\\n|8|2.50|7.54|\\n|9|1.20|7.54|\\n|10|1.70|7.54|\\n|11|2.30|7.54|\\n\\nAll significantly higher in the central portion of the study area (profiles 4–6 surrounding Kekaa Point) (Table 1). Beach profiles exhibit little to no transport of sediment offshore but they do show a significant change in beach face profile volume, which suggests longshore transport is acting upon the profiles (Figure 4). The distribution of profile volume change reveals the dynamic nature of the central portion of the study area and the clear decrease in mean profile volume away from the central area (Figure 5). We find that 65 percent of the net volume change occurs south of Kekaa Point confirming the increased variability of the southern portion of the area.\\n\\nMost profiles reveal a strong seasonal signal with net erosion in the summer and accretion in the winter. A closer look at the dynamics of the profile volume shows that the net volume for all profiles is highly variable over the 13-month period with the peak summer and winter months showing the largest net loss or gain from the mean (Figure 6). Net volume change from the mean suggests that June and January are the most dynamic months with approximately 14 percent and 13 percent of the total annual volume change respectively. In addition to seasonal trends, we find an alternating pattern of erosion and accretion alongshore (Figure 7). The alternating nature of the profile state switches alongshore with one profile contributing sediment to the neighboring profile seasonally.\\n\\n### Cumulative Beach Volume\\n\\nThe central Kaanapali region at profile 7 exhibits a strong seasonal volume change and reveals an inflection point in the trend of cumulative profile volume alongshore. We use the cumulative volume change of profile 7 as a proxy for LST because it represents the alongshore location where seasonal cumulative volume trends reverse sign and acts as a hinge point in the sediment transport regime, yielding a consistent location alongshore for comparative analysis with LST models (Figure 9). The observed cumulative net annual volume change at profile 7 is compared with the predicted transport rates of CERC (1991) Genesis model, KAMPHIUS (1991), and CERC (1984).\\n\\n### Wave Energy Flux\\n\\nIncident wave energy flux given by Fb = 2gTH/16 (CEM, 2001), where T and H are breaker height and period, and is used to compare the seasonal incident wave energy to the monthly total combined beach volume change (Figure 10). We observe a strong correlation of the total beach volume and thus LST, to the incident wave energy monthly mean. Total beach volume appears to be inversely related to south swell wave energy while beach volume is directly correlated to north swell wave energy. Thus in general, south swells tend to decrease the total beach volume while north swells tend to induce recovery of the volume.\\n\\n### Sediment-Reef Interface and Depth of Closure Estimates\\n\\nThe calculated profile DOC as defined by HALLERMEIER (1978) is in most cases significantly deeper than the first occurrence of hard substrate at Kaanapali (Table 2, Figure 8). Shallow continuous fringing reef is attached to the shoreline at profiles 1, 2, 9, and 10. Where no reef is present, as in profiles 4 to 6, the actual DOC closer approximates the predicted depth. Beach width variability is considerably more pronounced on those profiles not protected by fringing reef, while those landward of fringing reef tend to be narrow but more stable presumably due to the wave buffering effect of the reef. This is also consistent with there being less active sediment due to the hard substrate of the profile.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 19, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\n## Eversole and Fletcher\\n\\n|Observed and Predicted|\\n|---|\\n|Sediment Volume Transport|Longshore Transport|\\n|Study Area|\\n\\n| |40 CoJ|\\n|---|---|\\n|8|30 Cod|\\n| |20 Cod|\\n|k|10,C0o|\\n| |-10 Co0|\\n| |~20 COD|\\n| |~30,C00|\\n| |40,Cod|\\n| |50,CO0|\\n| |Profile Position|\\n\\nCumulative Gross and Net Annual Volume Change\\n\\n|Observed Summer Gross|E4-|Observed Annual Net|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Observed Winter Gross| |Genesis Predicted Annual Net|\\n\\nFigure 9.

Observations of net seasonal sediment volume change reveal a balanced seasonal exchange of net sediment at profile 9 and profile 5 (Table 3).

Similarly, we find that the predicted CERC (1984, 1991) and KAMPHIUS (1991) modeled LST rates for Kaanapali are sensitive to wave direction, period and height and closely follow wave energy non-linearly.\\n\\nEstimated LST rates from beach profile volumes are compared to the predicted CERC (1984, 1991) and KAMPHIUS (1991) predictions (Table 4). The CERC (1991) Genesis model best predicts the observed LST rates for Kaanapali (Figure 11) with a net annual LST rate within 77 percent of our observed mean gross annual rate. The KAMPHIUS (1991) model overestimates the net annual observed transport by approximately 6 103 percent while the CERC (1984) model overestimates observed transport by approximately 3 103 percent. The KAMPHIUS (1991) model utilizes several parameters that the CERC (1984) model does not such as; period, beach slope and mean grain size diameter.

They concludes a non-linear function of wave period that may account for it’s low prediction in the PING WANG et al. (1998) study and the large over-prediction in this study. The KAMPHIUS (1991) formula is especially sensitive to extremes in wave period and tends to deviate from observed transport estimates for unusually high (this study) and low (PING WANG et al. (1998)) wave periods.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 19, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\nEversole and Fletcher\\n\\nWe attribute the large difference in the model results to each model’s ability to accurately assess wave energy. The success of the Genesis model is attributed to its’ ability to account for wave energy flux for individual events rather than a time-averaged mean as applied to the CERC (1984) and KAMPHIUS (1991) formulas. The Genesis model also employs near-shore parameters such as antecedent beach conditions, bathymetry, wave shoaling, diffraction, and several shore face parameters not accounted for in the CERC (1984) or KAMPHIUS (1991) formulas.\\n\\nOverestimates of longshore transport using the CERC (1984) and KAMPHIUS (1991) models may be partly attributed to the use of seasonal significant wave height, period and direction as input parameters where as the CERC (1991) model utilizes an internal wave model that accounts for each wave event and considers the antecedent conditions of the shoreline. We attribute the large over-prediction of transport of the KAMPHIUS (1991) model partially due to the relatively large wave periods of Hawaii. Additionally, these formulas may overestimate transport of coarse, poorly sorted or dense sediment like Kaanapali Beach, due to the calibration of specific density of these formulas in finer, well-sorted silica beaches. This however does not account for the order of magnitude over-prediction observed in the models, which can partially be attributed to each model’s ability to accurately assess wave energy.\\n\\n|Trotal Net|4|\\n|---|---|\\n|Seoo ertynAnpul|Homo Kowal Reet|\\n|Fringing| |\\n|Acol Producuon| |\\n|Kaheklll Acci|41 m/yr|\\n|Kekea Point (Black Rock)| |\\n|Honokowa Gell| |\\n|Kaanaapall Gell| |\\n|Lengshore Stuospocal Studv| |\\n|BODGE and KRAUS (1991)| |\\n|Hanakoo Pt| |\\n|Hanalt Reel|02 mn|\\n|10| |\\n|8| |\\n|156 42 00/| |\\n\\nAlthough the CERC (1984) and KAMPHIUS (1991) formulas overestimate the observed transport by an order of magnitude they are still useful as a qualitative interpretive tool of the transport direction. Problems with the practical application of these formulas such as improper adjustment of the K coefficient of proportionality, recommended at 0.77 by the Shore Protection Manual, (CERC 1977; 1984) are common and can result in significant over prediction of LST.\\n\\nBODGE and KRAUS (1991) examined several inconsistencies in the practical application of the CERC (1984) formula and conclude that errors in field measurements can potentially yield errors in the LST formula by a factor of 2 to 4 times. Due to a prevailing overestimate of the LST by the CERC (1984) formula, the use of the suggested empirical ‘‘K’’ coefficient of 0.77 should be modified for practical applications. Reduction of ‘‘K’’ by an order of magnitude was found to yield more reasonable results (PING WANG et al., 1998; BODGE and KRAUS, 1991). This was found to be especially true on coarse, poorly sorted beaches with higher wave energy such as Kaanapali Beach. It is common practice to lower the K coefficient by an order of magnitude in order to achieve reasonable results of LST. We find similar results with the use of the CERC (1984) formula in this study with LST estimates approximately an order of magnitude higher than observed. If we apply a new K value of 0.07 instead of the suggested 0.77 we find a much better fit to the observed LST (Table 5).\\n\\nIn using the LST models and formulas, it is important to recognize each model’s strength and weakness and utilize the formulas collectively as an interpretive tool rather than an absolute gauge of LST. Each model should be used in conjunction with at least one other formula in order to confirm the gross and net transport direction and secondly as a rough\\n\\nFigure 13.

We find this method works very well in this study and yields consistent results on the direction of transport. All the models we employed agree on the direction of seasonal gross and net annual LST even though they vary widely on the magnitude.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nSurveyed beach profiles reveal a strong seasonal variability with net erosion in the summer and accretion in the winter. An alongshore-alternating pattern of erosion and accretion is identified from our beach profile surveys, manifested as large alongshore meanders (NORCROSS et al., in press). We find that 65 percent of the net volume change occurs south of Ke-kaa Point confirming the more dynamic nature of the southern (Kaanapali Cell). Net volume change from the mean suggests that June and January are the most dynamic months each with approximately 14 percent of the total annual volume change.\\n\\nObservations of gross seasonal sediment volume change reveal a nearly balanced longshore sediment transport system with the gross sediment loss at profile 9 accounted for by a nearly equivalent gain at profile 5 and confirms the presence of a strong seasonal longshore transport mechanism. We attribute the longshore transport of sediment from seasonal wave forcing with minimal cross-shore displacement. In general, south swells tend to decrease the total beach volume while north swell tends to induce volume recovery.\\n\\nLongshore transport rates are derived from seasonal cumulative beach volume change in the middle of Kaanapali Beach at profile 7. We observe cumulative net sediment transport rates of 29,379 ± 4400 m3/yr to the north and 22,358 ± 1300 m3/yr to the south for summer and winter respectively, a net annual rate of 7,021 ± 700 m3/yr to the north and a gross annual rate of 51,736 ± 5100 m3/yr.\\n\\nPredictive transport formulas such as the CERC (1984), CERC (1991), and KAMPHIUS (1991) predict net annual transport rates at 3 x 103 percent, 77 percent, and 6 x 103 percent of the observed transport rates respectively.\\n\\nThe fossil coral reef that fronts Kaanapali plays a significant role in the accuracy of the LST models. Shallow fringing reef truncates the subaqueous area of several of the beach profiles restricting the beach profile area actively involved in sediment transport and reducing the total volume that is available for sediment exchange. This effectively restricts the available sediment relative to the full sand profile beach system that the LST models are calibrated for. Great care must be used when applying LST models in areas with significant hard bottom or shallow reefs that alter the beach profile shape.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nThe authors would like to thank Kevin Bodge for his technical assistance in applying the LST formulas.

Within the last century, however, beaches on Oahu and Maui have been narrowed or completely lost, threatening tourism and construction development. In order for the counties and state of Hawaii to implement coastal regulations to prevent infrastructure damage, it is necessary to find a statistically valid methodology that accurately delineates annual erosion hazard rates specific to Hawaii. We compare the following erosion rate methods: end point rate (EPR), average of rates (AOR), minimum description length (MDL), jackknifing (JK), ordinary least squares (OLS), reweighted least squares (RLS), weighted least squares (WLS), reweighted weighted least squares (RWLS), least absolute deviation (LAD), and weighted least absolute deviation (WLAD). To evaluate these statistical methods, this study determines the predictive accuracy of various calculated erosion rates, including the effects of a priori knowledge of storms, using (1) temporally truncated data to forecast and hindcast known shorelines and (2) synthetic beach time series that contain noise. This study also introduces binning of adjacent transects to identify segments of a beach that have erosion rates that are indistinguishable. If major uncertainties of the shoreline methodology and storm shorelines are known, WLS, RWLS, and WLAD better reflect the data; if storm shorelines are not known, RWLS and WLAD are preferred. If both uncertainties and storm shorelines are not known, RLS and LAD are preferred; if storm shorelines are known, OLS, RLS, JK, and LAD are recommended. MDL and AOR produce the most variable results. Hindcasting results show that early twentieth-century topographic surveys are valuable in change rate analyses. Binning adjacent transects improves the signal-to-noise ratio by increasing the number of data points.\\n\\nADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: Coastal erosion, shoreline change rates, coastal management, Hawaii, erosion hazard area.\\n\\n### INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe coastal zone is one of the nation’s greatest environmental and economic assets (OCEAN STUDIES BOARD, 1999). In Hawaii, for example, over 60% of all jobs are related to tourism, which depends on the appeal of sandy beaches. Yet widespread beach erosion in the Hawaiian Islands threatens sand-dependent ecosystems and abutting coastal owners (FLETCHER, MULLANE, and RICHMOND, 1997; NORCROSS-NU’U and ABBOTT, 2005; ROONEY et al., 2003).\\n\\nRecognition of beach value led Maui County to approve and adopt in October 2003 the only science-based setback rules in Hawaii. These rules are based on erosion rates that are calculated by the reweighted least squares (RLS) method, which identifies and removes outliers before modeling the shoreline change trend with a straight line (FLETCHER et al., 2003; ROONEY, 2002; ROONEY et al., 2003). The slope of the line represents the erosion (positive slope) and accretion (negative slope) rate of the beach.\\n\\nAlthough comparisons of different shoreline change rate methods have been conducted along the continental East Coast of the United States, extensive research does not exist for beaches in Hawaii. Owing to fundamental differences between Hawaiian beaches and those of the continental mainland.\\n\\nDOI: 10.2112/05-0521.1 received 25 May 2005; accepted in revision 14 September 2005.\\n\\nFunding for this study was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey National Shoreline Assessment Project, Maui County, the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the Hawaii Coastal Zone Management Program, and a grant/cooperative agreement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Project #R/EP-22, which is sponsored by the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program, SOEST, under Institutional Grant No. NA16RG2254 from NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce.

Additionally, previous studies have not comprehensively tested shoreline change rate methods.\\n\\nOur goal is to compare published statistical shoreline change rate methods, including three statistical methods previously not used in calculating shoreline change rates. These comparisons are made using shoreline change data from the island of Maui. We first investigate the effects of outliers based on a priori knowledge (e.g., a devastating tsunami, hurricane, or storm event) on predictions that are based on shoreline change rates. We then compare different shoreline change rate methods using synthetically derived data. Finally, we examine the binning of adjacent transects to find beach segments that have indistinguishable change rates.\\n\\n### PREVIOUS WORK\\n\\nMost studies of shoreline changes have been done on continental beaches of the eastern United States. We review these and other studies that determine the most appropriate method based on either a comparative approach or the prediction of known positions.\\n\\nDOLAN, FENSTER, and HOLME (1991) compared long-term and short-term erosion rates with methods such as end point rate (EPR), linear regression (hereafter ordinary least squares, OLS), jackknifing (JK), and average of rates (AOR). By plotting the rates from one method vs. the rates of another method, they concluded that AOR is most variable, while OLS and JK share a high degree of similarity. They stressed that the best method depends on the objective and the temporal variables of the research.\\n\\nIn discussing beach erosion at Rinco´n, Puerto Rico, THIELER, RODRIGUEZ, and CARLO (1995) calculated erosion rates using EPR, OLS, JK, and AOR in the digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS, http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/dsas/). They divided their study site into four separate areas and calculated an average shoreline change rate at each section for each of the four methods. All four methods resulted in similar rates, but AOR was identified as the most appropriate shoreline change rate method at Rinco´n.\\n\\nDEAN and MALAKAR (1999) considered three shoreline change rate methods—OLS, EPR, and AOR—in mapping Florida’s hazard zones. They calculated correlation coefficients to compare the three methods. All three methods agreed with each other; however, EPR and OLS correlated better with each other than either did with AOR. The authors chose OLS as their preferred method.\\n\\nFENSTER, DOLAN, and ELDER (1993) introduced a new method, minimum description length (MDL), as an alternative to existing methods. Based on the MDL modeling criterion of RISSANEN (1989), this simplified version uses a complexity penalty to select the model that best fits the data (e.g., constant, linear, quadratic, etc.) with the fewest number of parameters. CROWELL, DOUGLAS, and LEATHERMAN (1997) compared predicted values from the MDL and OLS methods to actual values using sea-level data as a proxy for historical shoreline data. They concluded that OLS provides equal, if\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 23, No. 1, 2007\\n---\\n|Shoreline Change Rate Method|Advantages|Disadvantages|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|EPR|Simple computation|Only uses two end points; assumes linear trend|\\n|AOR|Uses measurement errors in identifying shoreline change rate|Assumes linear trend; minimum time criterion affected by large errors or small EPR; influenced by EPR rates of short time spans|\\n|MDL|Does not assume linear trend when identifying best model fit|Emphasis on recent data; analyst judgment is needed if model is non-linear|\\n|OLS|Simple computation; uses statistical tests|Assumes linear trend; sensitive to statistical outliers|\\n|JK|Decreases influence of clustered data and extreme data points; uses statistical tests|Assumes linear trend|\\n|RLS|Robust to statistical outliers; uses statistical tests|Assumes linear trend; removes data points before identifying trend|\\n|WLS|Incorporates uncertainties into trend line; uses statistical tests|Assumes linear trend; sensitive to statistical outliers|\\n|RWLS|Incorporates uncertainties into trend line; robust to statistical outliers; uses statistical tests|Assumes linear trend; removes data points before identifying trend|\\n|LAD|Robust to statistical outliers|Assumes linear trend; analyst identifies range of slopes and intercepts|\\n|WLAD|Incorporates uncertainties into trend line; robust to statistical outliers|Assumes linear trend; analyst identifies range of slopes and intercepts|\\n\\nSince short-term changes may affect long-term trends, FENSTER, DOLAN, and ELDER (1993) proposed a simplified form of the MDL method to help identify influential short-term changes. Assuming Gaussian errors, MDL uses an error component and a complexity penalty to select the best model fit, whether it is a constant, line, quadratic, etc. If the resulting model is quadratic or higher, two lines are produced—the zero-weight line (MDL ZERO), which uses only recent data, and the low-weight line (MDL LOW), which assigns weights to older data. MDL rates based on nonlinear models tend to result in variable or highly inaccurate forecasts, though the MDL criterion can help identify physical changes within a beach (CROWELL, DOUGLAS, and LEATHERMAN, 1997).\\n\\nLeast squares regression assumes independent Gaussian errors and estimates the trend of shoreline data by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals between the data and line. The estimated parameters (b0, or intercept; b1, or slope) are those that minimize Σ(yi - b0 - b1xi)2. The assumption of Gaussian errors is usually valid, since the sum of many sources of error, as occur in these studies, tends toward a Gaussian distribution. However, outliers that violate the Gaussian assumption will bias the apparent trend (SEBER and LEE, 2003). A priori knowledge of non-Gaussian data points (e.g., storm points) can be used to eliminate such points. Ordinary least squares assumes homoscedasticity.\\n---\\n|End Point Rate (EPR)|Average of Rates (AOR)|Average of Rates (AOR)|\\n|---|---|\\n|EPR|0.057|0.097 mlyr|\\n|AOR|0.127|0.072 mlyr|\\n\\n| |1900|1920|1940|1960|1980|2000|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Minimum Description Length (MDL)| | | | | |\\n| |Best model| | |quadratic| | |\\n| |MDL low| | |0.087 mlyr| | |\\n| |MDL zero| | |~J= 0.142 mlyr| | |\\n\\n| |1900|1920|1940|1960|1980|2000|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Jackknifing (JK)| | | | |0.039 mlyr| |\\n| |JK rate| |0.086 =| | | |\\n\\n|Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)|\\n|---|\\n|OLS|0.083 +0.036 mlyr|\\n\\n| |1900|1920|1940|1960|1980|2000|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Reweighted Least Square (RLS)| | | | | | |\\n| | | | | | |RLS|0.142 + 0.030 mlyr|\\n\\nFigure 1.

However, computing all possible linear trends is not efficient (DOLAN, FENSTER, and HOLME, 1991).\\n\\nReweighted Least Squares (RLS)\\n\\nRLS helps identify the true trend of shoreline change data by removing statistical outliers in the data. This two-step method first identifies outliers at a cutoff value using the least median of squares (LMS) regression. Points identified as statistical outliers are given a weight of 0, and all other points are assigned a weight of 1. An OLS fit then finds the trend with all data points of weights equal to 1. Unlike OLS, RLS is more robust and not as sensitive to outliers. RLS has a breakdown of 50% (that is, if 50% of the data are outliers, the trend of the data can be identified).\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 23, No. 1, 2007\\n---\\n## Predictive Accuracy of Rate Methods and Alongshore Beach Variation\\n\\n|Weighted Least Squares (WLS)| | | | |Reweighted Weighted Least Squares (RWLS)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|WLS|0.14|0.05 mlyr| | |RWLS|0.18|0.04 mlyr|\\n|Least Absolute Deviation (LAD)| | | | | | |\\n|LAD|0.06|0.12|0.14 myr| | | |\\n|[| | | | | | |\\n| | | | | |1920|1960|2000| | | | |\\n\\nFigure 2.

This can lead to significant alongshore variations in modeled shoreline rates that are inconsistent with natural beach dynamics. Thus, this method probably works best with a large amount of data or if data from adjacent transects are binned (discussed later) so that true outliers are more evident.\\n\\n## NEW EROSION RATE METHODS\\n\\nIn addition to the established methods discussed above, we explore three new methods to calculate shoreline change rates. These methods are based on well-established theoretical frameworks and are more robust than the least square methods described above (Figure 2).\\n\\n### Weighted Least Squares (WLS)\\n\\nUnlike OLS, WLS assumes heteroscedastic uncertainties. This means that the variance associated with each Y component (shoreline position) is not necessarily the same at each X component (time) (e.g., KLEINBAUM et al., 1998). If the\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 23, No. 1, 2007\\n---\\n|b0|0.00|0.25|0.50|0.75|1.00|1.25|1.50|1.75|2.00|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|2.00|22.36|16.86|11.56|7.72|6.51|7.62|10.77|16.14|21.64|\\n|1.50|19.61|14.11|9.19|6.14|5.40|8.10|13.39|18.89|24.39|\\n|1.00|16.86|11.36|7.24|4.69|5.55|10.64|16.14|21.64|27.14|\\n|0.50|14.11|9.29|5.29|4.01|7.89|13.39|18.89|24.39|29.89|\\n|0.00|11.74|7.24|3.65|5.75|10.64|16.14|21.64|27.14|32.64|\\n|0.50|9.69|5.23|4.60|8.47|13.39|18.89|24.39|29.89|35.39|\\n|1.00|7.64|5.25|6.95|11.22|16.14|21.64|27.14|32.64|38.14|\\n|1.50|7.29|6.45|9.47|13.97|18.89|24.39|29.89|35.39|40.89|\\n|2.00|8.18|8.47|12.22|16.72|21.64|27.14|32.64|38.14|43.64|\\n\\ncent shorelines. WLS will put more weight on the recent data. 2 with increments of 0.5, and slope, b 1, that ranges from 0 to The resulting trend line incorporates the uncertainty at each 2 with increments of 0.25, identifies a minimum misfit of 3.65. The slope and intercept estimates are 0.50 and 0.00, respectively (Table 2).\\n\\nThe uncertainty calculation for the slope estimate is more difficult than that of least squares. To obtain a range of slopes at a certain percentile, we first calculate an estimator of standard deviation (analogous to the root mean square error in least squares) and use it to compute the likelihood function, which in this case is the joint probability density function (PDF) of both the slope and intercept. The marginal PDF of the slope is obtained by integrating the joint PDF over intercept. The marginal PDF then gives the slope range at the percentile of interest. Unlike least squares, the slope range is not necessarily symmetrical around the peak of the slope PDF.\\n\\nThe major advantage of LAD is its robustness with respect to outliers. Similar to WLS, weights can also be incorporated in LAD (weighted least absolute deviation, or WLAD). Since there are only two parameters, LAD is not difficult to code. Care must be taken in selecting a range of slopes and intercepts to search from when using the grid search. If the range is not broad enough, or point spacing not dense enough, the resulting estimates of slope and intercept might not reflect the data accurately; however, the algorithm can be made self-checking and self-adjusting to overcome this minor difficulty.\\n\\nLeast Absolute Deviation (LAD)\\n\\nLeast absolute deviation is more robust with respect to outliers than least squares. Unlike the squared residuals of least squares, the sum of the absolute value residuals in LAD is minimized (i.e., misfit function is i yi b0 b1xi). Since the residuals are not squared, an extreme value has less effect in LAD than in least squares. The assumed distribution of measurement errors is a Laplace, or two-sided exponential, distribution rather than a Gaussian distribution, and the Laplace distribution’s longer tails make it less sensitive to outliers (TARANTOLA, 1987). In comparing robust estimators, ROUSSEEUW and LEROY (1987) stated that LAD is preferable to least squares methods when outliers are in the y direction, which is the case in nearly all historical shoreline analyses.\\n\\nCalculating the LAD estimate is not as straightforward as it is with least squares. A grid search is performed to calculate a misfit over a range of slopes and intercepts. The best fitting line is the one whose slope and intercept minimize the misfit. For example, an intercept, b 0, that ranges from 2 to\\n\\nReweighted Weighted Least Squares (RWLS)\\n\\nRWLS is similar to RLS except that it takes into account the uncertainties of each shoreline position. After identifying and removing outliers using LMS, a WLS line is fit to the data. Like WLS, RWLS incorporates positional uncertainties into the rate.\\n\\nIn order to apply this method, it is necessary for researchers to estimate all uncertainties associated with their study. As with OLS, this method is sensitive to outliers even if their weights are small. Hence, a priori knowledge is also important. The drawbacks of assuming a Gaussian distribution as discussed in the OLS section also apply to WLS. If the calculated uncertainties at each shoreline position do not accurately express the real deviations, then the resulting rate may underestimate or overestimate the true rate.\\n\\nSeveral sources of error influence the delineation of shorelines. For example, aerial photographs taken at various tide levels influence the location of the digitized shoreline, which in turn influences the resulting shoreline change rate. For our data, FLETCHER et al. (2003) made a special effort to identify and quantify all errors in order to assess the 1\\n\\nHAWAIIAN DATA AND UNCERTAINTIES\\n\\nTo calculate shoreline change rates in Hawaii, we digitize the toe of the beach as our shoreline position on images taken in different years (FLETCHER et al., 2003). The beach toe, which approximates the low water line, is a more accurate indicator for shoreline change analysis along Hawaiian coastlines when compared with the mean high water line (MHWL) (COYNE, FLETCHER, and RICHMOND, 1999; FLETCHER et al., 2003; ROONEY and FLETCHER, 2000).\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 23, No. 1, 2007\\n---\\n## Predictive Accuracy of Rate Methods and Alongshore Beach Variation\\n\\nThe errors are squared and summed to get a total positional uncertainty. We assume the total uncertainty follows a Gaussian distribution, since the central limit theorem states that the sum of multiple sources of uncertainty of arbitrary distributions tends toward a normal distribution (DRAPER and SMITH, 1998).\\n\\nWe use two different types of images to generate our shoreline positions—topographic surveys (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association T-sheets) and vertical aerial photographs. Only T-sheets that pass the National Map Accuracy Standards are used in this analysis (FLETCHER et al., 2003). The original surveyors of these T-sheets designated MHWL as the shoreline position. We migrate the MHWL in T-sheets to the low water line based on seasonally collected profiles.\\n\\nFollowing FLETCHER et al. (2003) and ROONEY et al. (2003), we calculate the total positional uncertainty (U t) using the equation:\\n\\n|U t|Er 2|Ed 2|Ep 2|Ets 2|Etd 2|Es 2|Ec 2|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|where Er|rectification error|Ed|digitizing error|Ep|pixel error|Ets|error plotting on a T-sheet|\\n| | | |Etd|tidal fluctuation error|Es|seasonal error|Ec|error in field identification of MHWL and low water line|\\n\\nErrors for T-sheets include Ets and Ec, and exclude Er and Etd. Aerial photographs do not include Ets and Ec.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\nShoreline Change Rate Comparisons\\n\\nForecasting and Hindcasting (Cross-Validation)\\n\\nFollowing HONEYCUTT, CROWELL, and DOUGLAS (2001), we compare the shoreline change rate methods discussed earlier by predicting known shoreline positions. For each prediction we calculate the difference between the actual and predicted position for all nine methods. We perform an ANOVA test at a 95% confidence interval to identify the differences. To compare the results of differing beach dynamics on Maui, we make forecasting predictions on two types of beaches—those with and without engineered (or hardened) structures. We make hindcasting predictions to check the validity of our earliest T-sheet points.\\n\\nWe compare EIPs of predictions that include storm-influenced points to EIPs of predictions exclusive of these points. Determining storm-influenced points is difficult in an island setting where different parts of the island are exposed to varying weather conditions. We classify three regions on Maui—Kihei, West Maui, and the North Shore—as each having its own distinct wave regime.\\n\\nComparing Methods Using Synthetic Beach Time Series\\n\\nSynthetic beach time series provide an alternative to hindcasting and forecasting. With synthetic time series, the calculated change rates of each method are compared with an assigned rate. We repeat this process 1000 times while keeping the true rate constant but varying the noise. Noise, in this case, is the scattering of the shoreline.\\n---\\nGenz et al.\\n\\nposition based on the known uncertainties and an additional though many caveats are associated with this analysis, forecasts and hindcasts suggest how well each rate method predicts future real data. On the other hand, the advantage of using the synthetic analysis is that the true synthetic rate is known, so the error of the predicted rate is also known. However, this analysis uses manufactured rather than real noise and assumes that errors are additive. Both prediction and synthetic results agree that MDL and AOR provide the least desirable results and OLS, WLS, RLS, RWLS, JK, and LAD are valid methods under certain conditions.\\n\\nForecasts\\n\\nExcluding pe Norp Shore, forecasts of positions wip hardened structures have lower EIP pan forecasts of positions free of hardened structures. The Norp Shore predictions (Table 3) wip pe 1960 storm position included in pe analysis have considerably higher EIP, which can be attributed to one beach where predictions made from T-sheets and 1960 positions did not reflect actual positions (Figure 4). Generally, predictions from OLS, WLS, RLS, RWLS, JK, EPR, and LAD are statistically not different and have pe smallest EIP. AOR and MDL are continuously singled out as mepods pat are significantly different from oper mepods because pey show appreciably higher EIP (Table 3).\\n\\nPredictions improve for all methods when storm-influenced shorelines are removed from the dataset. This improvement ranges from 0.1 m to 15 m. Geographically, the most improvement occurs on the North Shore with hardened structures. MDL and AOR improve more than other methods when outliers are removed (average not including North Shore 3.6 m). All least squares methods, JK and LAD, on the other hand, have minimal improvements when storm-influenced shorelines are removed for all regions (average improvement excluding the North Shore 0.7 m).\\n\\nHindcasts\\n\\nThe mean EIP for hindcasts is slightly larger than that of forecasts (Table 3). This increase is due to a lack of detailed information that surrounds T-sheets. A shoreline position from a T-sheet is not as well constrained and has a larger uncertainty associated with it than a shoreline position from an aerial photo. Hindcasts of beaches with hardened structures have lower mean EIP than beaches without hardened structures (excluding the North Shore). The hardened structures consist of seawalls, groins, and revetments, which may stabilize the beach on a short-term basis. Similar to forecasts, MDL and AOR hindcasts have high mean EIP and generally do not reflect the results of all other methods.\\n\\nRemoving storm-influenced outliers improves hindcasts minimally. Hindcasts of West Maui improve by only 1 m when storms are removed. Hindcasts of the North Shore with hardened structures are less accurate by an average of 2.4 m without storm shorelines (individual beaches have even a greater negative difference). This decrease in accuracy could be attributed to the storm shoreline having no negative influence on the trend; hence, it is not a true storm outlier for that area. All other areas, however, show marked improvement when storm-influenced outliers are excluded.

For each set, two runs were made—one with less noise and one with more noise. The significance of two standard deviations was also calculated for all rate methods using a Siegel-Tukey test. A method with a low standard deviation better identifies the true slope than a method with a higher standard deviation.

Since the whole beach does not necessarily behave in the same manner, we need to identify sections of the beach that are indistinguishable. Importantly, transects that have engineered structures and no beach fronting them are removed from this analysis because most coastal managers define these areas as having no erosion or accretion, and their inclusion will unduly influence rates calculated along the rest of the beach.\\n\\nTo identify which transects should be binned together and thus represent a section of beach where erosion rates are indistinguishable, we group adjacent transects and compare their combined rate to the combined rate of all other transects on that beach. The reader is referred to Figures 5–9 for a graphic illustration of the binning process. We start with a window spacing of four transects (Figure 5) and group the first four adjacent transects together and then calculate the shoreline change rate. We compare this rate with the rate of a bin of the remaining transects using a Student’s t-test (KLEINBAUM et al., 1998) at a 95% confidence interval to determine any disagreements (Figure 5, bottom). The window is then shifted over by one transect and a new t-test is performed. The window continues shifting by one transect until the last four transects are grouped together. Each time the window shifts, a t-test is calculated to compare the grouped transects within the window with the binned rate of the rest of the transects. The window size is then increased from four transects to six and the process of calculating a t-test is repeated. The window size is increased and the binning procedure is repeated until we reach a window size equal to (n transects)/2. When the binning procedure is complete, clusters of transects are identified by executing a Student’s t-test on groups of transects that are found to be statistically different from the rest of the beach. Within each window size, a t-test is performed on any overlapping transects (Figure 6). If the overlapping transects are statistically not different, they are grouped together.\\n\\nFigure 4. Predictions from a transect in Kahului. Predictions were made using the T-sheets and 1960 aerial photograph positions. Although a tsunami affected the area 5 mo before the 1960 photograph, accretion is predicted.

Top—Shore-normal transects are spaced 20 m alongshore. In this example, transect window length is four. The erosion rate of the first four adjacent transects (1) is compared with the rate of all the other transects in this beach. Next, the erosion rate of the next four transects (2) is compared with the rate of all other transects. This continues throughout the beach (3 and 4) until the rate of the last four transects is compared with the rest of the beach. The window spacing then increases to 6, 8, 10, etc. transects.

Horizontal lines represent groups of transects whose rates did not agree with the binned rates of all other transects (t-test).

Another t-test is performed to determine whether the bins at each window size are statistically different from bins of other window sizes that have overlapping transects. Bins that are found to be statistically not different are clustered together, and a rate is calculated for that region (Figure 8). For visual purposes, each cluster is assigned a color and each transect within a cluster is allotted a shade (Figure 9). The shade depends on the frequency of windows that intersect a given transect—transects that contain a higher frequency of windows that belong to the same cluster will be a darker shade than transects that have a lower frequency of windows. For example, in Figure 8, transect 57 has 27 windows that intersect it, while transect 51 has only three intersecting windows.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 23, No. 1, 2007\\n---\\n|Region|Beach|Wave Climate of Region|Offshore Bottom|Structures|Overall Bin Trends|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Kihei|Southern beaches (Big Beach, Little Beach, Maluaka, Onuli)|South swell, refracted north swell, and tradewind waves|No fringing reef|None|Northern portions of a beach are distinct from southern portions.|\\n|Kihei|Central beaches (Kam 1, Kam 2, Kam 3, Ulua)|Minimal south swell and refracted north swell, occasional kona storm waves|No fringing reef, sandy bottom|Seawall (on Ulua)|Uniformity within beaches|\\n|West Maui|Kaanapali, North Kaanapali, Keonenui, Kapalua|North Pacific swell, south swell, and kona storm waves|Portions have fringing reefs, rocky and sandy bottoms|Seawall (on Keonenui)|Erosion on one end of the beach and accretion on the other end of the beach|\\n|North Shore|Kaehu, Kanaha, Spreckelsville|North Pacific swell and tradewind waves|Fringing reefs|Five groins throughout beach (on Kanaha), offshore rock platform, and revetment (on Spreckelsville)|Eastern and western sections of the beach are distinct|\\n---\\n## Predictive Accuracy of Rate Methods and Alongshore Beach Variation\\n\\nSouth swells, and kona storm waves. North Pacific swells do not severely affect this area because it is located in the shadow of Molokai Island (EVERSOLE and FLETCHER, 2003; FLETCHER et al., 2002). Segments of the shoreline in this area contain fringing reefs, and only one beach has a seawall (EVERSOLE and FLETCHER, 2003; MAKAI OCEAN ENGINEERING AND SEA ENGINEERING, 1991). West Maui study sites depict a pattern of erosion at one end of each beach and either minimal erosion or accretion at the other end (Table 5).\\n\\nNorth Shore beaches are influenced by North Pacific swells and tradewind waves. Fringing reefs are widespread in this area (FLETCHER et al., 2002; MAKAI OCEAN ENGINEERING AND SEA ENGINEERING, 1991). The North Shore study area illustrates distinct behaviors between eastern and western sections of each beach. Two of the three beaches have engineered structures—one has five groins and one has an offshore rock platform with an onshore revetment. These two beaches exhibit more erosion than the beach without any structures (Table 5).\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nComparisons of Rate Methods\\n\\nBased on our synthetic work and forecasting analysis, we advise analysts to determine how well they understand the uncertainty in their methodology before picking the best erosion rate method. When uncertainties are mostly understood, weighted methods are recommended; conversely, if uncertainties are poorly understood, OLS, RLS, JK, and LAD are recommended. If doubt exists on the Gaussian nature of the uncertainty, LAD and WLAD are recommended. We are confident in our understanding of the major uncertainty components in our shoreline assessment study; however, we are not confident in our assessment of storm-influenced shorelines. As stated earlier, Hawaii is an island state and different beaches are affected differently by storms. The difficulty in identifying storm-influenced shorelines, together with the results from the synthetic storm analysis and the prediction analysis, is the basis for choosing RWLS as the most robust method for Hawaii.\\n\\nBased on the K-S test results of synthetic time series with less noise, weighted methods are far superior to all other methods (Table 4, columns A, C, and E). This superiority disappears as noise increases. As more noise is introduced to the data, the weights no longer reflect the uncertainty, and other methods that put more emphasis on the uncertainty in the model achieve better results (Table 4, columns B, D, and F). OLS, RLS, JK, and LAD outperform weighted methods when noise is sampled solely from a Laplace distribution. If, however, the majority of uncertainty components are known, weighted methods reflect the true process better (Table 4, column A).\\n\\nSynthetic time series results vary when storm shorelines are added to middle and end positions. The bias created by the storm shoreline at the middle position is not as detrimental in finding the long-term trend as the bias with a storm shoreline at the end position. This is because an end point is a leverage point that can influence the trend of the model more than interior points.

When segmenting the study area into individual beaches, some beaches have no significant improvement at the 95% confidence interval when storm-influenced shorelines are removed, while other beaches do. This could be due to differing storm or tsunami effects. Some beaches are protected from the full force of the waves by surrounding islands or fringing reefs, while others are more exposed.\\n\\nThe EIPs for hindcasts are somewhat greater than those of forecasts. This is because T-sheet positions usually have greater uncertainties than aerial photos (7–10 m). Hindcast predictions that are less than 10 m away from the true position are still within the uncertainty bounds of the true positions. We calculate a 95% confidence interval uncertainty around the predicted positions (Table 8). The minimum average uncertainty of the predicted positions is 15 m. By incorporating the uncertainties of both the true and predicted positions, even the North Shore predictions fall within the uncertainty bands. Also, removing storm-influenced shorelines does not improve the hindcasts. Thus, early twentieth-century T-sheet positions are valuable in the shoreline change rate analyses.\\n\\n## Table 8.

Statistical outliers, however, are critical components to consider when using least squares because of this method’s susceptibility to outliers, especially for small datasets. A large deviation at a point causes a bias in the trend if there are few data points, and this can be amplified if the point is at a leverage position. Some studies have attempted to relate statistics, such as residuals, to outliers. Focusing on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE), GALGANO, DOUGLAS, and LEATHERMAN (1998) state that storm-influenced residuals increase the error in the model fit and thus invalidate the model. They choose to use a priori information to remove these points, but the erosion rates with and without these points are not significantly different. FENSTER, DOLAN, and MORTON (2001) identify outliers by calculating studentized residuals and compare them with known storm dates. They find that none of the statistical outliers correspond to any known storms and advise not to remove them as outliers.\\n\\nFLETCHER et al. (2003) and ROONEY et al. (2003) identify and remove statistical outliers differently. As mentioned earlier, the least median of squares (LMS) method is part of a two-step process involving RLS or RWLS that calculates residuals (ROUSSEEUW and LEROY, 1987). They disregard a data point if a residual is greater than an assigned cutoff value. The cutoff value ( ) is an estimate of the true standard deviation of a population ( ), which is dependent on the sample size. For small sample sizes, there is less certainty in any estimate of the true  , making the cutoff boundary less exact and causing the removal or retention of too many outliers. If the outlier analysis at adjacent transects identifies different points as outliers, the resulting erosion rates are also likely to differ, leading to the case where physically adjacent beach segments are assigned inconsistent long-term trends. In our dataset with an alongshore spacing of 20 m, we find that adjacent transects do not behave independently of each other.\\n\\nOne way to use LMS is to increase the number of points used in the calculation of a trend, which can be done by binning data from adjacent groupings of transects and calculating a trend. Binning will reduce the spread, or uncertainty, around the cutoff value, which will improve the identification of outliers. Therefore, we recommend using a relatively large sample size to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and improve the estimate of the spread of the data ( ) when removing statistical outliers.\\n\\n### Binning Analysis\\n\\nSetbacks on Maui currently are based on erosion rates from transects spaced 20 m alongshore. Some adjacent transects have differing rates, which affect the setback location. Because only five to nine historical shoreline positions are available, the noise in the data can mask the signal. One advantage of binning is that by spatially increasing our points, we compare our binning results to the sediment transport study of EVERSOLE and FLETCHER (2003) at Kaanapali Beach in Maui in order to relate annual transport.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 23, No. 1, 2007\\n---\\nGenz et al.\\n\\nErosion Hazard Maps\\n\\nErosion hazard maps are important in identifying setbacks that are used by coastal planners. Based on the results of our study, we have produced erosion hazard maps that reflect the trend of shoreline movements more accurately than previously used maps (Figure 11). These new maps incorporate uncertainties of the shoreline change rate method and identify binned regions of a beach. The drawbacks of these maps include assumptions of a linear shoreline behavior, with no change in long-term effects of storms.\\n\\nThere are three major steps coastal managers need to take in order to produce erosion hazard maps (Figure 12). The first step is to identify a change rate method based on their data. The next step is to bin the data. For example, two bins are identified in Figure 11—one on the eastern end of the beach and one on the western end. Finally, transects of each bin are grouped together and a 50-year predicted position with a 1 uncertainty is identified by projecting the regression line into the future. The setback is calculated with 1 confidence bands placed on either side of the setback, which creates a hazard zone. Maui County measures the setback from the certified shoreline. The vegetation line is most often used as a proxy for the shoreline and includes a 6.1-m (20-ft) buffer that is designed to partially compensate for method errors, storm and tsunami hazards, and nonlinear shoreline change. In our analysis, the 50-year predicted position is calculated from low water line data; consequently, a vegetation line offset and buffer are added to the future position before the setback is projected onto the map.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nBy comparing the shoreline change rate methods and investigating outliers, we make the following conclusions. (1) OLS, RLS, WLS, RWLS, JK, LAD, and WLAD are preferred methods based on results from synthetic time series and forecasts. If major uncertainties in a methodology are known and quantifiable, WLS, RWLS, and WLAD are preferred. If uncertainties are unknown or not quantifiable, LAD is preferred, although OLS, RLS, and JK can be considered. If effects of storms are unknown or storm-influenced shorelines are hard to identify, RLS, RWLS, LAD, and WLAD are preferred. (2) We choose to use RWLS on Maui as our method based on our knowledge of uncertainties and our lack of confidence in identifying storm-influenced shorelines. (3) MDL and AOR produce the most variable results. (4) Early twentieth-century T-sheets are valuable in shoreline change rate analysis. (5) Hardened shorelines reduce variability of beach behavior. (6) Increasing the number of data points via binning neighboring transects in a RWLS or RLS analysis improves the estimate of spread in data when identifying statistical outliers.\\n\\nWe conclude from the binning analysis that (7) binning adjacent transects improves the signal-to-noise ratio.

Here we analyze a 5-km segment of the Kihei coastline (Maui, Hawaii) centered on an area of chronic coastal erosion. A high-resolution database of variations in shoreline sediment volume over the past century reveals a complex and dramatic pattern of changes between 1900 and 1997. Comparisons of historical sediment erosion and accretion at barriers to longshore transport are used to estimate longshore sediment fluxes over this period. In the absence of detailed long-term oceanographic and meteorological data for the site, fluctuations in the magnitude and direction of net longshore sediment transport (NLST) are a potentially valuable resource for investigating why documented changes have occurred. Available data suggest that observed patterns of NLST reflect multidecadal variations in Kona storm (strong, rain-bearing winds from the southwest) activity. These storms appear to be modulated by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which has a tendency to alter atmospheric circulation such that Kona storm activity in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands is reduced during its positive phase. Correlations among the PDO cycle, Kona storm activity, and NLST in Kihei, and the apparent inability of other possible forces to produce the observed patterns of NLST, suggest a cause-and-effect relationship. Consideration of the PDO may improve our understanding of coastal sediment dynamics in many areas, enhancing existing efforts to forecast erosion hazard areas and effectively manage sandy shorelines.\\n\\nADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: Shoreline change, beach erosion, Kona storm, Pacific Decadal Oscillation.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nSandy beaches are common along many of the world’s coastlines, yet our understanding of the behavior of beach and nearshore sediment systems on scales of years to decades remains limited. Movement of sediment by waves and currents is both complex and difficult to measure (e.g., WEIGEL, 1992; NRC, 1995; KOMAR, 1998). The many variables, operating over a range of time scales, and the general inability to predict erosion-causing forces confound our ability to accurately predict beach and shoreline dynamics (e.g., NRC, 1990; KOMAR et al., 1991; LIBBEY et al., 1998; THIELER, et al., 2000). As recommended by the National Research Council (NRC, 1990), the use of high-quality, computer-based historical shoreline change analysis, improved by correlation with data on oceanographic forces, is the only presently viable means of decadal shoreline prediction. The research reported in this paper is part of an ongoing effort to implement the NRC recommendation in the Hawaiian Islands.\\n\\nIn addition to the quantification of historical changes and projections of future erosion hazards, coastal managers expressed strong interest in finding out why the site investigated here is such a ‘‘hotspot’’ of coastal erosion. As with many other areas experiencing similar problems, understanding the causes of erosion can be difficult, especially when there are inadequate data available to conclusively address the question. Here we develop a high-spatial-resolution decadal to century scale database of historical shoreline fluctuations to assist in resolving this problem. These are analyzed in conjunction with records of climatic parameters to gain insight into the forces responsible for erosion problems at the study site. Although interpretations reported here cannot be considered definitive, disparate data and results all suggest a consistent scenario that is likely to have relevance to many Pacific shorelines. Serious coastal erosion problems are prevalent in many areas that also lack extensive long-term oceanographic and coastal monitoring programs. These problems, and the socioeconomic and ecological importance of beach resources, dictate the need for further research and the development of innovative methods for defining causes of shoreline change.\\n\\nSTUDY SITE\\n\\nThe study area (Figure 1) encompasses 5 km of coastline fronted by a fringing reef along the southwestern, or Kihei, coast of Maui, Hawaii.

As a result of chronic shoreline retreat, in time this resulted in the almost complete loss of sandy shoreline in front of the coastal armoring. Concerns over the severe and continuing loss of the beach resource prompted the present study.\\n\\nThe site terminates to the north at the rock walls of the ancient Hawaiian Koieie Fishpond, and the southern terminus is marked by a small rocky headland. These features define the north and south (respectively) endpoints of a large, open littoral cell. The reef flat fronting the site is 300 m to 400 m wide and 1 m to 2 m deep with a thin veneer of sand. Occasional large (approximately 5–10 m diameter) sand pockets are located across the reef surface. Seasonal change on the fringing reef-fronted beach is characterized by localized updrift accretion and downdrift erosion resulting from variations in longshore sediment transport rather than beach-wide erosion or accretion resulting from cross-shore transport (NORCROSS et al., 2003).\\n\\nThe site contains anthropogenic features that have influenced littoral sediment dynamics, including several ancient rock-wall fishponds.

Forming west of Hawaii, they tend to bring wind, rain, and large surf to normally leeward sides of the islands, typically generating waves with heights of 3–5 m and periods of 8–11 seconds. Occasional strong Kona storms have caused extensive damage to south- and west-facing shorelines, including the study site. Less severe damage has also been recorded as a result of the passage of unusually strong fronts on a few occasions (U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, 1967; MOBERLY, 1968; MAKAI OCEAN ENGINEERING AND SEA ENGINEERING, 1991; ROONEY and FLETCHER, 2000). We use the term ‘‘Kona storms’’ to refer to both true Kona storms and the rare frontal passages that have significantly impacted the Kihei coastline. Geomorphic evidence and anecdotal reports show that Kona storms have transported high volumes of sediment northward along the Kihei coast in addition to causing extensive erosion (ROONEY and FLETCHER, 2000).\\n\\nFigure 2.\\nCharacteristics of a typical major Kona storm. Shaded area is characterized by thunderstorms, rain clouds, and southwesterly winds. Isobars depict surface pressure in millibars, thin arrows show wind direction, and the heavy arrow indicates the direction of movement for the entire low (adapted from HARAGUCHI, 1979).\\ntrade winds accelerate through the central valley separating the volcanic peaks of West Maui and Haleakala. On leaving the valley the air stream diverges south along the Kihei coast and rises up the sun-heated western slope of Haleakala, forming an ascending spiral of air know as the ‘‘Maui vortex’’ (SCHROEDER, 1993). Thus, the Kihei coastline does experience strong trade winds, but they are usually northwesterly rather than from the northeast. The trade winds tend to accelerate in the late morning and reach their maximum speed in midafternoon. During times when these winds are active, sand can be observed moving southward by saltation along the dry beach and in the swash zone.\\n\\nSouth swell, generated in the Southern Hemisphere, usually impacts the Hawaiian Islands in the summer and early autumn. These events typically have deep-water wave heights of approximately 0.3–1.2 m and periods of 14–22 seconds (ARMSTRONG, 1983). The Kihei area is somewhat protected from south swells by the island of Kahoolawe but does receive wave energy from between Kahoolawe and the southwest corner of Maui. These, however, tend to dissipate, giving waves from the south less of an impact along the coastline that those from the southwest (U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, 1967).\\n\\nKona Storms\\n\\nAlthough somewhat protected by the islands of Lanai and Kahoolawe, the study site is susceptible to damage from Kona storms approaching from the southwest (Figure 2). Kona storms are ‘‘low-pressure areas (cyclones) of subtropical origin that usually develop northwest of Hawaii in winter and move slowly eastward, accompanied by southerly winds, from whose direction the storm derives its name, and by the clouds and rain that have made these storms synonymous with bad (Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 21, No. 0, 0000).\\n\\nMETHODS\\n\\nHistorical Shoreline Positions\\n\\nHistorical shoreline positions are used to determine sediment transport at the study site. Historical shoreline positions are acquired from both aerial photographs and NOAA topographic surveys, or T-sheets. Only 1:12,000 scale or larger series of vertical, survey-quality aerial photographs are used. Series of photographs meeting these criteria date from 1949, 1960, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1988, and 1997. Scanned images of the photographs from each series are corrected for distortion errors (THIELER and DANFORTH, 1994) and mosaicked together using software from PCI Geomatics, Inc., following the methodology of COYNE et al. (1999). We define the seaward and landward boundaries of the beach as the position of mean lower low water (MLLW) and the vegetation line, respectively (BAUER and ALLEN, 1995). The horizontal distance between them is defined as the beach width. Both features are digitized on each photomosaic, and the position of MLLW is used as the shoreline change reference feature (SCRF). T-sheet shorelines, available from 1900 and 1912 and covering the northern and southern halves of the study site, respectively, show the position of the mean high water line (MHWL). MHWLs are shifted seaward a distance equal to the median distance between the MHWL and the MLLW position, as measured from 5 years of seasonal beach profiles taken within the study site (GIBBS et al., 2001). Movement of these features is measured along shore-normal transects nominally spaced every 20 m along the shoreline. Further details are available from ROONEY (2002) and FLETCHER et al. (in press).\\n\\nVolumetric Shoreline Change\\n\\nFive years of seasonal beach profile surveys within the site (GIBBS et al., 2001) are used to develop a model, modified from BODGE (1998), that estimates volumetric changes along the coast as a result of historical shoreline movement (Figure 3). The model has terms to account for changes in the sandy\\n---\\nAllen Press • DTPro System GALLEY 30 File # 03em\\n\\nName /coas/21_103 09/02/2004 08:54AM Plate # 0-Composite pg 30 # 4\\n\\nRooney and Fletcher wave trains arriving from countless wave generation areas, accounting for the different transport directions.’’ KOMAR (1998) and the Coastal Engineering Manual (U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, 1998) state that structures blocking longshore sediment transport (LST) can provide the best evidence of the magnitude and direction of NLST, particularly over longer time scales. A structure that interferes with LST will trap a portion of the sediment moving along the shoreline on its updrift side, resulting in accretion, and induce erosion on its downdrift side. To gain insight to why the shoreline has changed through time, a single time series of NLST is developed for the entire study site. The NLST record is based on the volumetric difference in sediment impoundment around rocky headlands and anthropogenic structures on the shoreline, as indicated by historical shoreline positions. Despite structures at both ends of the site that partially isolate it from neighboring shorelines, differences in the total volume of coastal sediments over time show that the site does exchange sediment with other areas. Although the best method for quantifying long-term rates of longshore transport, shoreline structures will often not trap 100% of the sediment moving along the coast, so this method will usually underestimate rates of NLST. Northward transport values are assigned positive values here, whereas southerly transport is indicated by negative values. One structure, the Halama groin (see Figure 1), was not constructed until after the 1949 photographs were obtained. Additionally, armoring on the southern portion led to beach loss and the lack of significant sand resources for LST by 1988. These two major physical changes at the site necessitate the use of multiple sediment-trapping features to develop a complete times series. Further details are available in ROONEY (2002).\\n\\nFigure 3.\\nModel to convert horizontal movement of beach boundaries to volumetric units.\\nshoreface portion of the profile as well as the vegetated coastal plain. Together these give the total change in volume, Vol, under a 1-m-wide shore-normal strip. That result is multiplied by 20 m, the width of beach represented by each measurement of historical shoreline movement or transect. This procedure can be written as:\\n\\nVol [(G p * X) (Veg * Z)] * 20 (1)\\n\\nin which Vol is the total volume change for a 20-m-wide strip of beach, G p is the ratio of changes in shoreface volume to beach width characteristic of this site, X is the change in beach width, Veg is the horizontal movement of the vegetation line, and Z is the elevation difference between the coastal plain and depth of closure. From Equation 1, volumetric changes are calculated for each time increment of our shoreline history at 20-m alongshore spacing. Volumetric uncertainty for a single transect results from uncertainty caused by position error of MLLW and vegetation line positions, error in the Z term (1.0 m), and error in the G p term (40%). These are assumed to be independent for each transect, so the total volumetric uncertainty of each is defined as the root sum of squares of these terms, multiplied by the 20-m longshore distance each transect represents. Individual terms used to calculate volumetric uncertainty are assumed to be dependent alongshore, so transect volumetric uncertainties are therefore summed over the shoreline segment of interest (see FLETCHER et al. (in press).\\n\\nAnother component of the sediment budget that should be considered is the contribution of coralline algae, coral, foraminifera, and other carbonate sediment-producing organisms found at the site. HARNEY and FLETCHER (1999) measured sand production and assign gross calcium carbonate production rates of 1.4 and 7.0 kg m2/yr, respectively, to Hawaiian reef flat and slope environments. From surface area measurements for each environment and other terms from their sediment production model, total in situ sediment production within the site is estimated for the period between 1900 and 1997. Further details on calculating sediment volumes are available from ROONEY and FLETCHER (2000).\\n\\nNet Longshore Sediment Transport\\n\\nKOMAR (1998) defines net longshore sediment transport as ‘‘the summation of the movement [of sediment] under all Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 21, No. 0, 0000\\n\\nKona Storm Activity\\n\\nA record of Kona storms that may have impacted this coast was compiled from several published sources, and augmented in a few cases by anecdotal reports (NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, 1959–1998; U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, 1967; SHAW, 1981; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, 1905–1948). Oceanographic and meteorological data to quantitatively compare Kona storms are not available. However, given the reported significance of Kona events in this area, it is important to attempt to evaluate their impact on coastal erosion, which we accomplish using the published descriptions. Kona events are cataloged and assigned a magnitude from 0 to 4 based on the expected duration of changes they induced on the sandy portion of the Kihei coastline, as shown in Table 1. Durations are based on observations of the persistence of major changes to the shoreline induced by specific Kona events. Based on considerations of increased wave height, storm surge, and duration typical for each magnitude, we assume that each increase in event magnitude will result in a 10-fold greater impact to the shoreline. In other words, an M3 event will induce northward transport of an order of magnitude more sediment than an M2 event.\\n\\nThe record has shortcomings: (1) details are frequently sparse, leading to speculation about a storm’s impact, (2) reporting of events was not always consistent, and (3) histori- cally, the record is incomplete.\\n---\\n## Shoreline Change and Climate: Maui, Hawaii\\n\\n|Magnitude*|Duration of Effects|\\n|---|---|\\n|0|No effect|\\n|1|A single season|\\n|2|1 year|\\n|3|5 years|\\n|4|20 years|\\n\\n### RESULTS\\n\\nVolumetric Changes\\n\\nThis coast has been quite dynamic over the past century, receding or prograding almost 100 m in some areas, which is several times the width of the average Hawaiian beach. Because of variations in coastal morphology, shoreline change is more comparable for different areas when expressed in units of sediment volume, rather than as horizontal movement. Detailed information on the timing, magnitude, and location of sediment volume changes help to characterize the behavior of this coast and yield clues as to why the changes occurred. Figure 4 gives a complete history of volume changes, based on measured movement of the vegetation line and the shoreline as applied to Equation 1. The smoothed surface illustrated in the figure is generated by fitting continuous curvature splines (SMITH and WESSEL, 1990) to all volume change data for the 1900 to 1997 period and reflects the net result of all sediment transport processes for the entire study site. Estimates of volume change associated with a variety of specific shoreline processes are shown in Table 2.\\n\\nBetween 1912 and 1997, the reef-fronted southern portion of the study area lost 1.7 x 10^5 4.2 x 10^4 m3 of sediment. The greatest losses occurred at the southern end of Kalama Beach Park between 1912 and 1949, with the shoreline receding as much as 90 m. Net erosion during this period gradually decreased to the north and was replaced by accretion from the middle of Halama Street to the south side of Koieie Fishpond. By 1949, the southern end of Kalama Park had stabilized and changed little until a revetment was constructed along the length of the park in the early 1970s. Between 1949 and 1997, erosion continued, but the area of greatest erosion shifted gradually north from the middle of Kalama Park to several hundred meters south of the Halama groin.\\n\\nThe northern half of the site prograded significantly between 1900 and 1997, accreting about 4.16 x 10^5 4.5 x 10^4 m3, or about three times more sediment than was lost in the south.\\n\\nSuperimposed on the above major patterns of shoreline change are several smaller features that are discernible in Figure 4. A series of major storms in the early 1960s caused widespread erosion and accretion in a few localized areas, while post-storm recovery induced an opposite pattern between 1963 and 1975. The Halama groin had an obvious impact on the coastline, causing about 4.2 x 10^4 m3 to accrete along its southern side while the downdrift or northern side experienced erosion. Localized accretion of approximately 2.3 x 10^4 m3 of sediment in the Kawililipoa area is also evident in Figure 4.\\n\\nIn estimating sediment production, the area of the reef characterized as 'reef slope,' covering 0.46 km2, is assigned a gross CaCO3 production rate of 7.0 kg m^2 yr^1. The 'reef flat' area encompasses 1.28 km2 and is assigned a production rate of 1.4 kg m^2 yr^1.

These are plotted against their estimated impact, as dots in Figure 6 along with a proxy record of Kona storm activity, rainfall in Waianae, Oahu. The cumulative sum of the residuals (differences between each data point and the mean of the entire dataset, summed from the start of the record through the given data point) of winter season rainfall, is plotted as a black line. Periods of higher than average rainfall show a positive slope, whereas periods with lower than average rainfall show a negative slope.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nCauses of Shoreline Change: Geomorphic Evidence\\n\\nClues to why the shoreline has changed are available from geomorphic evidence. Fishponds within the site, at least one of which is at least 500 years old (RYAN, 2000), are still located at the water’s edge, suggesting a long-term balance in sediment dynamics. This is despite a relative sea-level rise of 2.1 mm y-1, according to NOAA tide gauge records from Ka-Vull chanu.\\n\\nFigure 5. Time series of mean rates of NLST and dVt (changes in volume for the entire site) over each period between historical shorelines. Note that because of lack of data, the dVt record shows a single estimated mean rate of change for the 1900/1912 to 1949 period, and the NLST record shows different rates for 1900 to 1912 and 1912 to 1949.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 21, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\nAllen Press • DTPro System GALLEY 33 File # 03em\\n\\nName /coas/21_103 09/02/2004 08:54AM Plate # 0-Composite pg 33 # 7\\n\\nShoreline Change and Climate: Maui, Hawaii along the coast. Over the 97-year period covered by the study for example, in situ production accounts for only 20% of the net sediment accumulation. On time scales of years to decades, sediment transport processes are predominant shapers of the coastline. On the other hand, as the timescale of interest becomes longer, in situ sediment production and storage become increasingly important components of the sediment budget. Long-term storage of biogenic sediment was demonstrated by HARNEY et al. (2000), who found that fossiliferous sand up to 5000 years old dominates the surficial sand reservoir at Kailua Beach on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. On scales of thousands of years, sediment production and storage are responsible for creating the beach and become important geologic processes.\\n\\nFigure 6.\\nDates and relative magnitudes of major Kona storms and frontal passages on the Kihei coast in the historical record are plotted as black dots. The cumulative sum of the residuals of winter season precipitation in Waianae, Oahu is shown as a solid line.

The shoreline around Koieie Fishpond in 1900 (Figure 4) was about 30 m further seaward on its north side and 60 m further landward on the southern side relative to the 1997 shoreline. Such a configuration is indicative of southward NLST prior to 1900. The head of Maalaea Bay is only 4 km to the north, so there is limited fetch within the bay for wave development at the site. The area is also well sheltered from waves arriving from the northwest, north, east, and southeast. Hence, there does not seem to be a mechanism to move high volumes of sediment to the south. This suggests that the 1900 shoreline reflects a significant period of dominantly southward, presumably trade wind-driven, LST. Between 1900 and 1949, however, the north side of the fishpond accreted about 20 m while the south side accreted about 40 m. Between 1949 to 1960, and 1960 to 1963 the north side eroded 36 m and 12 m, respectively, while the south side experienced jumps in accretion of 7 m and 15 m, respectively. There were a number of major Kona storms in the first half of the 1900–1949 period as well as between 1949 and 1960 and especially during the 1960–1963 period. This can be seen in Figure 6, which depicts major Kona storms and their estimated relative impact on the Kihei coast. Movement of the shoreline around Koieie Fishpond is indicative of northward NLST during these periods, and is interpreted to be a result of intensive Kona storm activity.\\n\\nBetween 1963 and 1997 there was particularly heavy localized accretion in the Kawililipoa area. The sequence of aerial photographs for this area documents gradual shoreward movement of accumulations of reef rubble conglomerate. Similar features, described as ‘‘coral-conglomerate tongues,’’ have been identified along South Pacific island shorelines and interpreted as reworked storm deposits (RICHMOND, 1997). We hypothesize that the rubble material at this site may have been broken off the reef during major Kona storms in the early 1960s and gradually pushed towards shore. Whatever their origin, these features have been interrupting LST along the coast here, resulting in the localized accretion of 2.3 104 m3 of sediment since 1975.\\n\\nAnnual in situ sediment production, 530 m3, is relatively small compared to the total volume of sediment transported Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 21, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\nAllen Press • DTPro System GALLEY 34 File # 03em\\n\\nName /coas/21_103 09/02/2004 08:54AM Plate # 0-Composite pg 34 # 8\\n\\nRooney and Fletcher\\n\\natively minor erosion at the site from this event is likely because of the presence of coastal armoring. The impact of armoring is also apparent in the statistics on beach widths. Between 1949 and 1997, mean beach width for the entire study site decreased by 44%, primarily reflecting a drop in front of the armored shoreline, from 16.9 m to less than 1 m. This serious loss of the beach resource is particularly significant given its vital role in the visitor industry, which is the predominant source of jobs and income in Maui County. Kona events and episodes of south swell since the late 1980s would have, in the absence of armoring, eroded the vegetation line landward, exposing sand from the coastal plain in the southern half of the site to the active littoral system and helping to maintain a healthy beach.\\n\\nNet Longshore Sediment Transport\\n\\nMovements of the historical shoreline positions documented in the present study are much too large to be simply reflecting seasonal variations at the site, which average less than 4 m (FLETCHER et al., in press). As seen in Figure 4, in areas within the study site showing major change, episodes of accretion and erosion are manifested as incrementally greater displacements of the shoreline from one year of coverage to the next. If cycles of shoreline erosion and accretion of a comparable magnitude were occurring between intervals of photographic coverage, there would be aliasing issues with the historical shoreline positions. However, such large-amplitude movements would be evident in the photographs, in the form of much wider beaches reflecting insufficient time for vegetation to become reestablished, infrastructure that had been destroyed and not rebuilt, etc. Evidence of such fluctuations are not seen in the photographs or reported in the literature or anecdotally. This observation and the persistence of many of the major changes to the shoreline (e.g., accretion on the south side of the Halama groin) indicate that the historical shorelines are effectively documenting long-term trends in shoreline behavior.\\n\\nRates of NLST, shown in Figure 5, are the integrated result of all transport processes that occurred during the period between historical shorelines. Features used to estimate NLST experience some leakage of trapped sediment, and there is significant sediment exchange between the study site and shoreline areas to either side. The method used here will tend to underestimate NLST in situations in which there is a significant component of cross-shore transport. The accuracy of the curve is impacted by the limited number of historical shorelines available, which results in periods lacking data. In addition, unless a shoreline position happens to capture the configuration of the coast just as there is a change in LST, our rates will integrate both the earlier and later magnitudes and directions of sediment transport. Hardening of the shoreline, construction of the Halama groin, and development of the reef rubble structures at Kawililipoa have all acted to reduce the ability of sediment to move along the coast.\\n\\nThe record of total volumetric changes along the shoreline is well constrained relative to that of NLST. It is useful, therefore, to compare the two, to ensure that values of NLST are reasonable.

The pattern of NLST, however, shows an increasing southward component during this time, further reinforcing the hypothesis that hurricanes have not been the dominant force inducing shoreline change.\\n\\nAlthough tsunamis have had a major impact on portions of the Hawaiian coastline, the Kihei area seems to be well protected, particularly from tsunamis originating in the Northern Hemisphere. Although there have been 4 tsunamis with measurable runup within Maalaea Bay over the past century, only the tsunami of May 22, 1960, originating in south central Chile, appears to have had a significant impact in Kihei (LANDER and LOCKRIDGE, 1989; WALKER, 1994; FLETCHER et al., 2002). This event flooded Kalama Park and caused light to moderate damage to 11 houses, but there are no reports of beach erosion (MAUI NEWS, 1960). We conclude that tsunamis have had only a minor impact on sediment dynamics in Kihei over the period covered by this study, while several lines of evidence suggest that Kona storm processes are likely responsible for most of the changes to the shoreline within the study site.\\n\\nPacific Decadal Oscillation\\n\\nENSO events, typically occurring every 3 to 4 years (GODDARD and GRAHAM, 1997), exert a significant influence on Kona storm activity in Hawaii. They tend to last 6 to 18 months and may go from one extreme to the other, e.g., from a strong El Niño to a strong La Niña event, in adjacent years (DIAZ and KILADIS, 1992). These characteristics make it difficult to discern multidecadal variations in the ENSO signal that might correlate with and explain the changes in NLST. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), however, has been described as an ENSO-like climatic fluctuation, with warm and cool phases that generally last 20–30 years (MANTUA et al., 1997; ZHANG et al., 1997). The terms ‘‘warm’’ and ‘‘cool’’ are commonly used to describe phases of both the PDO and ENSO. They refer to SSTs of the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean and along the west coast of the Americas (HARE et al., 1999).\\n\\nThe leading eigenvector of North Pacific monthly sea surface temperatures poleward of 20 N for the 1900–1993 period has been established as an index to compare the relative intensity of the PDO (MANTUA et al., 1997; MANTUA, 2000). Anomalies in the mean SST, sea-level pressure (SLP), and wind stress fields associated with a positive phase of the PDO are illustrated in Figure 7. A positive phase is characterized by a wedge-shaped body of anomalously warm water in the eastern equatorial Pacific, surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped band of cooler than normal water, with a drop in sea level pressure centered over the Aleutian Islands. This pattern reverses during the negative phase. ENSO events exhibit patterns that are broadly similar to, but of greater intensity than, those of the PDO and more focused in the tropics, whereas the PDO is most pronounced at higher latitudes (MANTUA et al., 1997; ZHANG et al., 1997). There is strong evidence that the PDO modulates ENSO events such that there is a greater tendency for strong El Niños (La Niñas) during positive (negative) phases of the PDO (GERSHUNOV and BARNETT, 1998; GERSHUNOV et al., 1999; MCCABE and DETTINGER, 1999; MANTUA et al., 1997). Winter season means of the PDO index and MEI are consistent with their findings, correlating at well above the 95% confidence level. Although each phase of the PDO lasts 20–30 years, it may contain intervals of several years in length in which the sign of the PDO index is reversed. These high-frequency shifts are difficult to distinguish from actual phase changes of the PDO, except in hindsight, and appear to have the same impact on ENSO (MANTUA et al., 1997).\\n\\nIndependent researchers have evidence for two full cycles of the PDO over the past century, with cool phases from 1890–1924 and 1947–1976 and warm phases from 1925–1946 and 1977 to about 1998 (MANTUA et al., 1997; MINOBE, 1997). Other researchers have found evidence of PDO-like climatic fluctuations extending further back in time, suggesting that the PDO may be a true internal oscillation. Using tree ring data and proxy records of SST from corals, MINOBE (1997) and LINSLEY et al. (2000), find evidence of PDO-like climatic fluctuations as far back as the 1700s. BAUMGARTNER et al. (1992) document similar variations extending back to AD 270 based on scales from anchovy and sardines preserved in Santa Barbara Basin sediments. Considerable debate exists, however, over all aspects of the PDO, with the observed climatic fluctuations attributed to causes ranging from simple manifestations of stochastic external forcing (HUNT and TSONIS, 2000) to oscillations of the ocean atmosphere system, with a variety of trigger and feedback mechanisms invoked (e.g., LATIF and BARNETT, 1996; GU and PHILANDER, 1997).\\n\\nAlthough its signal is most pronounced at higher latitudes, the PDO has been shown to induce changes in climate near Hawaii. CHU and CLARK (1999) document an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones in the central North Pacific between 1982 and 1997. They note that the changes appear to be modulated by decadal-scale changes in SST, with warmer conditions during this period, perhaps leading to stronger El Niño events as well as greater tropical\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 21, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\nAllen Press • DTPro System GALLEY 36 File # 03em\\n\\nName /coas/21_103 09/02/2004 08:54AM Plate # 0-Composite pg 36 # 10\\n\\nRooney and Fletcher Cumulative Residuals\\n\\n|Figure 8.|The cumulative sum of residuals of the PDO (gray line) and Waianae rainfall (black dotted line).

The correlation between NLST and the sum of Kona impacts over periods between historical shorelines (gray line) from Figures 9b and 9c (r 0.532) is significant at the 80% confidence level.|\\n\\nPositive PDO phases are characterized by a general tendency for anomalously warm SSTs in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, inducing a migration of the midlatitude storm belt and, as with El Nino events, enhancing the tendency for the ridge aloft to be found in the vicinity of Hawaii. Both mechanisms tend to suppress Kona storm activity in the islands (T. SCHROEDER, personal communication). It is expected, therefore, that there will be fewer Konas during positive PDO phases and more during negative ones.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that NLST along the Kihei coast during positive PDO phases is characterized by a relative lack of Kona storm-driven transport, and dominated therefore by trade wind-driven southward NLST. During negative phases, however, we expect a greater than average level of Kona storm activity and increased potential for northward NLST. To test these hypotheses, we compare our record of NLST in Kihei with local climate histories (the precipitation and Kona storm records from Hawaii) and the PDO index.\\n\\nLeeward Rainfall and the PDO\\n\\nAs discussed earlier, a local proxy for Kona storm activity in the Hawaiian Islands is winter rainfall in Waianae on Oahu. The cumulative sum of residuals of total winter season rainfall and winter season means of the PDO index are shown in Figure 8. Areas on these curves with a positive (negative) slope represent periods of lower (higher) than average measurements. To more clearly illustrate its relationship to the precipitation time series, the Y-axis of the PDO plot has been reversed. The previously mentioned changes in PDO phase are shown in the figure as alternating gray and white backgrounds and appear at the same time as major changes in slope from the two curves.\\n\\nThe PDO and Waianae rainfall time series each describe or reflect multidecadal climatic shifts; hence, there is a tendency for successive measurements to have similar values. Reducing the degrees of freedom before testing for significance can accommodate this nonindependence of the data. We use both CHEN’s (1981) technique and another method commonly applied in analyzing climatological data (J. LOSCHNIGG, personal communication) for reducing the degrees of freedom for the correlation. Both methods are based on autocorrelations of the data but vary as to which is more stringent when applied to a given time series. The second method, which we refer to as the ‘‘1/e’’ technique involves running an autocorrelation on, for example, annual values of the PDO index. Autocorrelations are run for lags from zero to n 1, and the values of the correlation coefficient, r, are plotted against the number of lags.

The latter is compared to a time series of Kona impacts, PDO and Kona storm activity, and Kona storms appear to have been able to induce the observed changes in NLST, while other possible forces do not appear to have caused them. Given these considerations, and the correlations and PDO-ENSO-Kona storm linkage discussed above, we conclude that there is strong evidence that the PDO does exert a significant influence on Kona storm activity in Hawaii. By suppressing (allowing) Kona storm activity in main Hawaiian Islands when it is in a positive (negative) phase, the PDO is found to reduce (enhance) northward NLST, over decadal time scales, within the Halama study site.\\n\\nThe PDO and Shoreline Change Prediction\\n\\nThe study site discussed here is uniquely situated, facing to the south and protected by West Maui and other islands, such that more of its decadal-scale sediment dynamics are driven by Kona storms than probably any other stretch of coast in at least the Hawaiian Islands. However, many other Pacific shorelines are impacted by forces that show some degree of response to the PDO. As discussed above, the PDO strongly influences hurricane activity near Hawaii and, although the affect may change for different areas, across the entire equatorial Pacific (CHU and CLARK, 1999). Positive PDO phases, which are associated with a deepening of the Aleutian low, appear to be linked to the occurrence of large winter season waves in the Hawaiian Islands. Particularly large North Pacific swell events are found to correlate at the 95% level with unusually high PDO index values, suggesting that these shoreline-modifying events are also modulated by the PDO (ROONEY et al., in press). We anticipate that as further research is conducted, sediment dynamics along many Pacific shorelines will be found to be strongly influenced by PDO-controlled forces.\\n\\nAn understanding of the physics driving the PDO is required before we will be able to predict PDO-induced impacts to the shoreline on decadal time scales. Given the PDO’s long period and the relatively short duration of observational records, longer-term proxy records of climatic data must be developed to address the many questions regarding this phenomena (CANE and EVANS, 2000). Despite shortcomings in our understanding, the PDO’s tendency to persist for decades gives it some use as a tool for enhancing ENSO-based climate and weather predictions (GERSHUNOV and BARNETT, 1998; GERSHUNOV et al., 1999; MCCABE and DETTINGER, 1999).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nOver the period 1900 to 1997, net accretion of 4.2 105 m3 of sediment occurred in the north part of the Kihei coastline while the southern part experienced a net loss of 1.5 105 m3. This pattern suggests that there has been net northward longshore sediment transport. The timing of shoreline changes suggest that the bulk of sediment dynamics have been caused by natural, rather than anthropogenic, forces. However, sediment impoundment through hardening of the shore-\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 21, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\nAllen Press • DTPro System GALLEY 38 File # 03em\\n\\nName /coas/21_103 09/02/2004 08:54AM Plate # 0-Composite pg 38 # 12\\n\\nRooney and Fletcher line is primarily responsible for an observed 50% decrease in mean beachwidth and rates of NLST and is estimated to have resulted in a loss of 4.2 104 m3 of sediment to the active beach system between 1975 and 1997. Production of calcium carbonate on the adjacent fringing reef is estimated to have added about 5.2 104 m3 of sediment between 1900 and 1997, indicating that it is a markedly less important process than LST at these time scales.\\n\\nWe discuss results of a case study of the not uncommon situation of an area with a serious coastal erosion problem, but with very little oceanographic and other data available to facilitate a thorough evaluation. Given the importance of the beach resource and need for improved management indicated by severe loss of that resource, it is necessary to use what data are available to make the best possible analysis of what is causing these changes. Here, unique wave exposure characteristics at the study site enable the use of a history of NLST to gain insight into forces responsible. It has been suggested (e.g., MANTUA et al., 1997) that the PDO modulates aspects of atmospheric circulation in the Pacific, causing ENSO-like fluctuations in SST and SLP. We hypothesize that migration of the midlatitude storm belt and an enhanced tendency for the ridge aloft to be located in the vicinity of Hawaii are characteristic of positive PDO phases. These cause below-average Kona storm activity in the Islands and result in trade wind-driven southward NLST during positive PDO phase. During negative PDO phases, higher than average Kona storm activity occurs, resulting in northward NLST. Historical records and dissimilarities between patterns of NLST, hurricane activity, and tsunamis suggest that hurricanes and tsunamis have had a relatively minor impact over the last 150 years. We find statistically significant correlations among the PDO index, Kona-related precipitation, historical Kona storm activity, and NLST calculated from shoreline movement. Historical data appears therefore to support the hypothesis that the PDO exerts a primary control on decadal-scale fluctuations in shoreline behavior in Kihei. Given the PDO’s influence on hurricanes and North Pacific swell in Hawaii, and other Pacific basin-wide changes, it probably exerts some control on sediment dynamics in many other areas as well. Consideration of PDO impacts is likely to improve management of beach resources on many Pacific shorelines.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nThe authors thank Drs.

ISSN 0749-0208.\\n\\nShort-term and long-term change in Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, enhance resource management; shoreline swells heights from bi-monthly beach profiles reveal short-term variations. Increased wave heights correspond between May and October, while shorter period wind waves predominate between November and April. An estimated volume loss of approximately 167,000 m³ was found between October 2000 and May 2002. The Koyo Harbor to Ululani Street historical shoreline change history (1925-2000). The shoreline has migrated seaward over this period, reflecting high beach width has increased due to human intervention. Littoral cell accounts for 93% of the loss. Historical volume changes applied establish history of shoreline volume fluctuations, typically with subsequent beach loss. Volume documented fluctuations after 1985, the entire shoreline budget for Waikiki reveals volume deficit of at least 77,000 m³. Despite beach nourishment, sediment and permanent offshore losses. Between 1951 and 2001, the un-nourished shoreline.\\n\\nADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: beach erosion, change photogrammetry, Hawaii.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nDespite these efforts, today major segments of the shoreline have stabilized the sand at high tide and few will disagree that the beach is in a degraded state. Waikiki is an engine for the State of Hawaii. The Hawaiian place Waikiki, translates to \\'spouting waters\\'. The image that embodies the old Waikiki consists of urban corridor generates 44% originating from annual tourism expenditures in Hawaii and is responsible for 140,000 jobs.

The former wetland has developed into commercial center of Honolulu backed by continually expanding high-rise construction. The beach is largely a product of tropical visitor.\\n\\nPurpose and Goals\\n\\nThis study was initiated at the request of the State of Hawaii to document past and present beach changes in order to enhance resource management. The engineered beach was created by placement of natural sands and sand-like materials from other locations to provide a necessary basis for planning the execution of any major restoration. Here, we integrate approximately years of modern beach littoral history, describe beach dynamics on a cell basis.\\n\\nPresent Address: ETI Professionals, St. Petersburg, FL 33701.\\n\\n600 4th Street South\\n---\\n## Waikiki Shoreline Analysis\\n\\nThe Royal Hawaiian Hotel\\n\\nThe Royal Hawaiian Groin\\n\\nFigure: Waikiki Bench 1927.

The first developments of growing tourism in the late 1800s concluded that beach nourishment and groins could be curc emerge, including hotels used seawalls as the primary cause of growing tourism in the late 1800s (GERRITSEN, 1978; U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, 1992).\\n\\nDuring the same time period, plans were underway to turn Waikiki district wetland into an urban community.

Larger beach widths are typically observed at the northwest ends of the cells. The seaward extent of profiles is determined by the depth and proximity of ground control or imagery to fringing reef. In general, profiles extend farther offshore at slightly greater depths along the central portion of the shoreline where the fringing reef is less distinct.|1|\\n|Historical mosaic Vertical/horizontal changes in the profiles occur from the berm crest to the beach beyond which beach response is limited by the presence of fringing reef. Profile volumes (per alongshore distance) range from 21 m^3/m at profile to 207 m^3/m at profile.|1|\\n|Identify and digitize profile volume changes relative to the mean are plotted. At Kaimana Beach, most volume change occurs. Photogrammetry procedures net volume increase of 10 m^3/m at profile is influenced by the February 2002 beach-grading project performed by the City and County of Honolulu. At Queens Reach, volume fluctuations are largest at profile adjacent to 110 m concrete profile and rubble mound groin. Profile changes at Kapiolani Beach between consecutive surveys are nearly imperceptible.|1|\\n|Volume changes for profiles 10 and 11 at Kuhio Beach are impacted by human intervention, with rapid volume fluctuations in May 2001 and May 2002 due to engineered sand transfer from profile 10 to profile 11. Net losses of 20 m^3/m are observed at the centrally located profiles 10 and 11.|1|\\n|Volume changes for profiles 11 and 12 at Kuhio Beach north basin are synchronized and show minor variation over the study period. Volume fluctuations are greatest in the Royal Hawaiian littoral cell, being dominated by losses at profiles 15 and 16 at the north end of the beach.|1|\\n|The G value is applied historically computed for each littoral transect. Volume changes occurring at profiles 18 and 20 show net losses on the order of 5 m^3/m. DeRussy Beach shows relatively small volume changes over the study period, with most volume loss equal to total volume change for 20 m wide shore normal transects at profile 21.|1|\\n|Volume gains at profile 21 are equal to total volume change for 20 m wide shore normal transects.

At profile net loss of 4.6 m/yr for winter months noted similar results from profile GERRITSEN (1978) suggesting net loss of 5.6 m/yr for summer months observing neither nourishment nor loss of beach sands. This data indicates that environmental conditions control stability. Winter erosion at Kapiolani Beach: 513 m³ sand volume loss at Queens Beach. It is notable that substantial erosion event volume gain observed over the study period, with slight deficit of sand observed only at the centrally located profile.\\n\\nVolume (Figure 10C) (January 2002) equates to beach width decrease. Recovery at profile began immediately, but significant progress toward large achieved after swell event with heights up to 2 m. The beach nearly returned to its pre-erosion condition showing that summer wave swells tend to restore sand of the beach. The erosion rate is only 0.1 - 0.0 m/yr. Historical Behavior: average beach narrowing of 13 m from 1951 to 1970. Queens Beach is an erosion hotspot on the Waikiki shore, volume loss of 982 m³ corresponds to 13 m³. This can probably be credited to an initial sediment following beach construction. The US ARMY CORPS ENGINEERS (1992) indicative of the 1956 beach construction project. However, analysis is limited to photo coverage but severe erosion continued until equilibrium was attained.\\n\\nSince that time, beach toe position has been fairly static, excepting the period from 1975 to 1985. Seaward migration of the beach in 1962 depicts undernourished beach in 1985. Hurricane Iwa (November 23-24, 1982) again resulted in beach narrowing and volume loss between 1985 and 1992. Queens Beach: An August 2001 City and County of Honolulu landscaping project furthered seaward encroachment of the vegetation line. There are significant avenues of sand sources for natural beach replenishment. If erosion continues at the same rate, Queens Beach may experience nearly 10 m/yr erosion.\\n\\nLittoral Cell 3: Kapiolani Beachward shift of the vegetation line at profile. This contributes to 23% and 63% reduction in beach width along this 210 m section. Profile changes at Kapiolani Beach are nearly imperceptible, implicating a relatively stable setting.

The reasons for the discrepancy are short-term behavior change and beach volume change.\\n\\nBeach Width Profile Data:\\n\\n|Kuhio Beach|Results|\\n|---|---|\\n|Changes in the position of 223 m³ net volume gain is observed for the basins that over the toe on the modern beach result in small profile volume changes; the minimal slope (0.2) of the regression line centrally located profiles probably due to their positions forming the dV/dX relationship.| |\\n|Small gaps in the offshore breakwaters. This effect is directly related to the sand trapping effects of the Kuhio Beach. Sand losses occur at these sites when overtopping the breakwave.| |\\n|Under basins wave conditions, beach sand migrating directed return flow, scours bottom from the subaerial trapped with sediment and transports sand outside the basins. Beach over time can become responsible for gradual shallowing effect in the basins and create a shallow effect.| |\\n|The same forces may result in volume losses at offshore regions of the land while the beach progrades. Following effect remains nearly constant while the beach progrades.| |\\n|On the other hand, basin configuration prior to 1975 was not identical to basin configuration today. We therefore assume northwest transport to the south basin is evident by beach configuration. Coupled basin shallowing; the effects beach behavior may have been significantly different; with conclude that using the modern dV/dX relationship may not be appropriate.| |\\n|Despite historical and landward after periods of gradual widening, the overall volumetric result is minimized by the against the central slope line. In addition, the dV/dX regression in volume change data for April 2001 and again in April 2002, the losses at profile 10 equate to gains at profile compounded by seaward shift of the promenade between 1970 and 1975.| |\\n|Profiles 11 and 12, in the basin, behave in unison. After 1975, problems associated with methodology are less pronounced, presumably because most construction had been finalized by that time and the beach began contributing to behave in a linear manner similar to the modern beach shape and making transport patterns variable and difficult to decipher.| |\\n|Volume loss at profile may partially result from transport to the south and may be responsible for 1991 nourishment. Sand fill is evidenced in the southwest corner of the basin, despite short-term gains Kuhio Beach remains in minor volume increase average failing between 1985 and 1992.| |\\n|Beach loss has characterized the past decade with a narrowing of the beach. Progressive landward migration of the beach toe, along with additional seaward advancement of the promenade seawall, contributes to the observed losses. Under high tide conditions, there is no dry sand beach.| |\\n\\nLittoral Cell 5: Royal Hawaiian Beach\\n\\nShort-term Behavior\\n\\nHistorical Behavior\\n\\nThe Royal Hawaiian Beach exhibits the most dynamic behavior in Waikiki. Most beach changes occur along the western half of the beach at profiles 15 and 16. Despite numerous efforts, the Kuhio shoreline demonstrated chronic erosion and volume loss at an average rate of 0.2 m³ per year.\\n\\nEvidence of major beach construction is documented by comparing our T-sheet shoreline with the 1951 shoreline. The 1925 T-sheet shows a segment of shoreline located in today\\'s basin. The toe position records the 1939 beach construction with an approximately 39 m seaward shift between 1925 and 1951.\\n\\nThe beach retained its widest configuration, an average width of 47 m, directly following construction of the south basin. Prevailing erosion rise to Kuhio\\'s narrow configuration in 1970 at a loss of approximately 30 m. Restoration efforts are responsible for the 17 m increase in beach width from 1970 to 1975.\\n---\\n|AUMiller andFletcher|Kalmana BeachRoyal Hawaiian Beach|\\n|---|---|\\n|Modtun Salling|Qucens Aeach|\\n|Halekulani Beach|peroeth|\\n|approach|Kapi\\'olani Beach|\\n|Ft.

A reweighted least squares (RLS) regression is applied to the most recent trend in the data to calculate average annual erosion hazard rates and delineate the 30-year erosion hazard area. Historical movement of the vegetation line and beach step crest is used to estimate net sediment transport. Between 1912 and 1949, the southern coastline of the study site receded rapidly, an average of 1.8 m/yr. In successively later time intervals, the focus of erosion migrated northward. Some of the eroded sediment may have been deposited in the northern part of the site, which accreted three times more sediment than was eroded from the south. Significant net sediment transport to the north had occurred by 1912, prior to extensive known anthropogenic disturbance of the shoreline. Net accretion, and timing of the observed changes, suggest natural forcing is primarily responsible. An overall shift from accretion to erosion starting around 1975, and low rates of net sediment transport since then, are primarily due to sediment impoundment from the proliferation of coastal armoring that began in the early 1970s. Beach erosion is a serious problem in Hawaii, as evidenced by the 44% mean decrease in beach width at this site from 1949 to 1997.\\n\\n### INTRODUCTION\\n\\nBeaches are a tremendously important cultural, recreational, economic, and ecological resource in the state of Hawaii. They are, for example, a vital cornerstone of the visitor industry, which has supported 31 percent of the state\\'s gross product since 1990 (DBEDT, 1999). Despite their importance, beaches on all the main Hawaiian islands are seriously degraded (Makai Ocean Engineering and Sea Engineering, 1991; Sea Engineering, 1988). On the island of Maui, it has been estimated that one third of the original sandy beach has been lost or narrowed over the last half century (Fletcher and Hwang, 1994). As a first step toward better protection of their beach resources, coastal zone managers need to have accurate, detailed information about historic patterns of shoreline change (Fletcher and Lemmo, 1999). The research reported here was designed to provide such information for a study site centered on the southwest coast of Maui. Techniques and methodologies developed at this site are now being applied to study all of the significant sandy shoreline areas on Maui to improve understanding of island-wide coastal sediment dynamics.\\n---\\n## Study Area\\n\\nThe study area (Figure 1) located in the town of Kihei, Maui extends along 5 km of coastline fronted by a wide reef and terminated to the north by the rock walls of the ancient Hawaiian Koieie Fishpond. The southern end of the reef-fronted area is marked by a small natural rocky headland. South of that are a number of pocket beaches characterizing the remainder of this coastline. The first of these, Kamaole I Beach Park, is also included within our study area. In 1949 the entire stretch of coastline except for the rocky headlands had a relatively wide sandy beach. Since then, 1800 m of the originally sandy shoreline has been replaced by seawalls and revetments.\\n\\nThe site is in the lee of West Maui and the islands of Molokai, Lanai, and Oahu, relative to the large north pacific swells that impact Hawaii every winter. Likewise, it is largely protected from chop and swell generated by the brisk trade winds, which occur about 70 percent of the time, particularly in the summer months of May through September (Haraguchi, 1979).\\n\\nFigure 1. Halama Study Site\\nFiguire 1. Halama Study Site\\n\\n|Trade winds along Kihei coast|Molokai|\\n|---|---|\\n|Trade wind transport|Moloka\\'i|\\n|Kihei coast|Maul|\\n|Trade wind transport|Fenpino|\\n|Kona storm transport|southern SOUTHERN SWELL|\\n\\nTradewinds on Maui tend to accelerate through the central valley separating the volcanic peaks of West Maui and Haleakala. The winds diverge upon leaving the valley and the air stream that is diverted south along the Kihei coast rises up the sun-heated western slope of Haleakala, forming an ascending spiral of air known as the \"Maui vortex\" (Schroeder, 1993). Thus the Kihei coastline does experience strong tradewinds, but they are usually from the north (alongshore) rather than from the northeast.\\n---\\n## Although somewhat protected by the islands of Lanai and Kahoolawe, the study site is vulnerable to storm and wave events that approach from the south and southwest:\\n\\nSouth swell, generated by storms in the southern hemisphere, usually impact the Hawaiian Islands in the summer and early autumn. These events typically have wave heights of about 0.3 m to 1.2 m, periods of 14 to 22 seconds (Armstrong, 1983).\\n\\nKona winds are stormy, rain-bearing winds that blow from the south or south-southwest. They accompany low-pressure systems approaching the islands from the west and are most common in the late winter and early spring. Kona events can generate wave heights of 3 to 5 m and periods of 8-10 seconds. Although kona winds occur only 10% of the time and are usually light, the occasional strong kona storms have caused extensive damage to south and west-facing shorelines, including the Kihei coast (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1967; Makai Ocean Engineering, Inc. and Sea Engineering, Inc., 1991).\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\nHistorical Shoreline Positions\\n\\nHistorical shoreline positions were acquired from both aerial photographs and NOAA T-sheets. Only 1:12,000 scale or larger, vertical, and survey-quality aerial photographs were used. Photographs meeting these criteria dated from 1949, 1960, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1988, and 1997. Scanned images of the photographs were corrected for distortion errors (Thieler and Danforth, 1994) and mosaicked together following the methodology of Coyne et al. (1999). Approximately five ground control points (GCP\\'s) were selected per photograph from the 1997 series. Differential global positioning (DGPS) was used to determine the position of each GCP to within a few millimeters.\\n\\nScanned images were imported into commercial rectification software (PCI Geomatics, Inc.). Rectification utilizes the GCP\\'s, the principle point of a photograph, and information about the camera. The process orients an image so that true north is up, assigns it a common map projection (UTM) and datum (WGS84), and rubber sheets it to best fit the GCP\\'s. The middle of a rectified image has better position accuracy than the edges, so only the central third of each image was used when joining rectified images together. A batch of images joined together in this way is then resampled to bring them to a common scale of 0.5 m per pixel. The resulting photomosaic is a georeferenced image of a continuous stretch of coastline.\\n\\nIn rectifying images from years prior to 1997, both GCP\\'s and pass points are used. Pass points are precise features that are visible in both the 1997 photomosaic and the historical image to be rectified. A photomosaic was made for each of the earlier series of photographs. The rectification process is currently the most time-consuming part of the entire analysis. We will be investigating an aerotriangulation method and use of rectified satellite images as a means to decrease our production time and improve the accuracy of our photomosaics.\\n\\nWe define the crest of the beach step and the vegetation line as the seaward and landward boundaries of the beach, respectively (Bauer and Allen, 1995), and the horizontal distance between them as the beach width (Figure 3). We track the movement of the beach step crest through time to calculate erosion rates. Coyne et. al. (1999) defined the shoreline change reference feature (SCRF) as the beach step crest in their work for the FEMA \"Evaluation of Erosion Hazards\" study.\\n---\\nAlthough somewhat protected by the islands of Lanai and Kahoolawe, the study site is vulnerable to storm and wave events that approach from the south and southwest: South swell, generated by storms in the southern hemisphere, usually impact the Hawaiian Islands in the summer and early autumn.

We track the movement of the beach step crest through time to calculate erosion rates. Coyne et al. (1999) defined the shoreline change reference feature (SCRF) as the beach step crest in their work for the FEMA \"Evaluation of Erosion Hazards\" study.\\n---\\nWhere the seaward extent of vegetation is limited by seawalls or revetments, the vegetation line is vectored along the seaward side of the structure. The crest of the beach step is also delineated along the base of coastal armoring where there is no subaerially exposed beach during high tide. On armored shorelines, these features follow the estimated position of the mean high water line (MHWL). Following these definitions, the beach width for armored coastlines that are no longer fronted by sandy beach is zero.\\n\\nShoreline position error is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of total measurement error, tidal, and seasonal fluctuation of the SCRF. Total measurement error is the square root of the sum of the squares of rectification error, digitizing error, and pixel accuracy (0.5 m). Tidal fluctuation is the maximum horizontal movement of the beach step crest measured between the lowest and highest tides during a spring tide, at several locations. Seasonal fluctuation is calculated from the mean movement of the SCRF at the 95% confidence level between the 1987 (summer) and 1988 (winter) photomosaics.\\n\\nTopographic Survey Charts\\n\\n|Content|Page Number|\\n|---|---|\\n|Historical shoreline positions are also acquired from topographic survey charts or T-sheets. A T-sheet for the northern half of our study site is available from 1900, and one for the southern half, with about 130 m of overlap from 1912. Copies were obtained from a private vendor working with the National Archives, and from the National Ocean Service respectively. The mean high water line (MHWL) from both surveys was digitized on a Summagraphics Microgrid III digitizing pad set at 0.127 mm (0.005 in) resolution, with the operator wearing 2.75 power binocular magnifiers. Triple replicates of each shoreline are made, and the median shoreline position used for analysis. T-sheets were originally produced in the Old Hawaiian Datum. Digitized T-sheet MHWLs are converted to WGS84 by overlaying with the 1997 photomosaic. MHWLs are shifted seaward a distance equal to the median distance between the median MHWL and the crest of the beach step, as measured from five years of seasonal beach profiles taken within the study site. As with the photomosaic shorelines, T-sheet shoreline uncertainty is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of several terms, including digitizing error and seasonal fluctuations. The tidal fluctuation term is replaced with uncertainty associated with conversion of the MHWL to the beach step crest, and is set at 7 m based on profile data. A term is added also to account for uncertainty associated with the plotted position of the shoreline on the T-sheet. Its value is set at 5 m from Shalowitz (1964), and confirmed by measurement of offset between prominent rock outcrops and other features common to the T-sheets and 1997 photomosaic.| |\\n\\nErosion Rates\\n\\nTo calculate erosion rates, all historical shorelines are overlain on the 1997 photomosaic and a time series of movement histories calculated every 20 m in the alongshore direction. We determine an end-point rate (EPR) using the earliest and latest shoreline positions (e.g., Foster and Savage, 1989; Dolan et al., 1991). Inspection suggests that the entire study site can be described using 13 sub-cells (Figure 2). The pattern of shoreline change is consistent within a sub-cell, and the pattern is different or distinct from those of neighboring sub-cells. Further inspection of shoreline history reveals that several sub-cells.\\n---\\ndisplay significant change in shoreline behavior through time: Because they are not well characterized by any single erosion rate we calculate a rate based on the most recent trend in the shoreline; the projected annual erosion hazard rate (AEHR). This is calculated by taking the slope of the reweighted least squares (RLS) regression line fit to the data points included with the most recent trend. Details of the RLS regression are discussed later. For transects experiencing erosion, the AEHR is used to define the 30-year erosion hazard projected from the 1997 vegetation line. Volumetric Shoreline Change As mentioned above, a profile line (one of approximately 90 statewide) established within our study site was surveyed each summer and winter for five years. The profile data are used to develop a model estimating volumetric changes along the coast from historical shoreline movement information (Figure 3). The model, modified from Bodge (1998), uses the change in beach width (ΔX) as a proxy for change in volume under the profile (ΔV) based on the ΔV/ΔX slope of a regression line running through the origin and fit to the data yields what Bodge (1998) refers to as the \"Gp\" value, expressed here as: Gp = ΔV/ΔX = volume change per unit shorelength change in beach width. The Gp term has units in this case of m³ per meter of beach width change per meter along the shoreline, or mm. Given that the profile data was collected each summer and winter over a relatively short (five-year) timespan, our Gp value better reflects seasonal variation than it does a long-term trend. The Gp value is multiplied by the change in beach width (ΔX) determined from aerial photo history, to yield a volume change for a 1m wide strip of the active, sandy beach. This comprises the first term in our volumetric change model:\\n\\n285\\n285\\n---\\nThe second term accounts for the change in volume associated with movement of the vegetation line: It reflects long-term variation in which the vegetation line moves significantly (Morton and Speed, 1998), and is calculated from two measurements. The first, ΔZ, is the elevation difference between the base of the actively changing profile (depth of closure) and the average elevation of the vegetated coastal plain, as seen in the profiles.\\n\\nΔVol = [(Gp * ΔX) + (AVeg * ΔZ)] * 20, in which:\\n\\n- ΔVol = total change in volume for a 20 m wide shore-normal strip\\n- ΔX = horizontal change in beach width\\n- Gp = slope of the best fit line from a plot of AV / ΔX\\n- AVeg = horizontal movement of the vegetation line\\n- ΔZ = elevation difference between the coastal plain and the depth of closure, as seen in profile data\\n\\nResults from the model for the North Halama sub-cell compared well with measurements of volume change in the area. Using the above equation, volumetric changes were calculated for each time increment of our shoreline history at 20 m alongshore spacing, and for each sub-cell.\\n\\n## Sediment Production\\n\\nThe primary components of the beach and nearshore sediment within the study site are calcareous, produced by foraminifera, red algae, mollusks, coral, and echinoids (Moberly, et. al., 1963). Since all of these organisms can be seen living in the area today, we estimated current rates of in situ sediment production. Two different types of reef environment are found at the Halama study site. There is a large reef flat area with low percentages of live coral cover, and a smaller reef slope area with high percentages of live coral cover. The surface area of each is measured from the 1997 photomosaics. Gross calcium carbonate production rates of 1.4 and 7.0 kg m-1 yr-1 respectively are assigned to the reef flat and slope environments (Harney and Fletcher, 1999). They further estimate that 50% of the gross CaCO3 production is reduced to sediment, and that 50% of that sediment is trapped within the reef.\\n---\\nframework That leaves the remaining 50% potentially available to add to the framework. That leaves the remaining 50% potentially available to add to the beach sediment reservoir: The highest production rates are found on the reef beach sediment reservoir. The highest production rates are found on the reef falls slope, which is on the outer edge of the reef platform. Once sandgrain slope, which is on the outer edge of the reef platform. Once a sand grain falls over the outer edge of the reef platform it will be quite difficult for it to be redeposited on the reef platform: We estimate therefore that 50% of the sediment produced and not trapped within the reef framework is removed Platsfoma sediment produced and not trapped within the reef framework is removed The from the reef system by transport off the edge of the reef from the reef system by transport off the edge of the reef platform. The remaining 50%, or 12.5% of the gross CaCO; production estimated t0 be remaining 50%, or 12.5% of the gross CaCO, production, is estimated to be added to the beach system: Total sediment production for the entire reef area fronting the study site was estimated for the time period between 1900 and 1997 and compared to the volumetric shoreline changes estimated above.\\n\\nRESULTS Although linear rates of shore and vegetation line movement and their associated volumetric changes are calculated at a 20 m spacing; for ease of interpretation, results tabulated below are for the 13 study site sub-cells.\\n\\n|Interval|1900|1912|1900|1949|1960|1963|1975|1988|Mean|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|/Sub-cell|1912|-1949|-1949| | | |1988|1997| |\\n|Koieie| |-|17.9|-30.2|-11.2|6.3|-13.3|3.5|-4.5|\\n|Waipuilani|-| |45|3.9|-1.0|5.3|-11.0|-0.3|7.0|\\n|Kawililipoa|23.2|20.7|29.8|11.3|-0.9|11.6|5.4|-0.1|7.4|\\n|Azeka PL:|-|16|-|14.8|-1.5|5.6|1.8|-0.7|6.0|\\n|Azeka PI.|-|14.2|-|8.8|29|2| | |35|\\n|St. Theresa|-|14.2|-|8.8|2.9|-9.4|-0.3|4.7|3.5|\\n|N.

It is almost always present in Hawaiian beach systems and is often the only feature other than the vegetation line that is visible in the aerial photographs. Tracking movement of the vegetation line along developed shorelines in Hawaii can be problematic. For example, at many locations within this study site, the vegetation line has been artificially stabilized behind coastal armoring while the beach in front has gradually disappeared. Analysis of movement of the vegetation line in these areas would erroneously suggest that the coastline is stable. It has been recommended (Morton and Speed, 1998) that shoreline features sensitive to short-term fluctuations in sea-level, including the high water line (HWL), not be used to monitor shoreline position. They suggest the use of features which more closely follow the long-term movement of the shoreline. For these reasons listed above, and because this particular project is geared towards monitoring of the condition of the beach as well as overall shoreline movement, we have chosen to use the beach step crest as our SCRF. See Coyne et al. (1999) for a further discussion of this topic.\\n\\n## T-sheets\\n\\nThere has been discussion in the literature over the advantages and disadvantages of including data from T-sheets in studies of shoreline change. The primary argument against their use has been that their accuracy is questionable (Smith and Zarillo, 1990; Dolan, et. al., 1980). It has been pointed out by others that the modest increase in position uncertainty that is incurred by using T-sheets is more than offset by the benefits realized from the greater temporal coverage they provide (Crowell et. al., 1993; National Research Council, 1990). Particularly large position uncertainty, 14.3 m for most of the study site, results from digitizing at the 1:20,000 scale of the 1912 T-sheet. Position uncertainty from the 1900 T-sheet, at a scale of 1:10,000, is 11.9 m for most of the study site, compared to 8.1 m for shoreline positions derived from photographs. However, including T-sheets at this site is quite useful as they double the time period covered and reveal significant shoreline changes that preceded aerial photographic coverage.\\n\\n## Erosion Rates\\n\\nA number of methods have been used to calculate erosion rates from historical shoreline position data. Some of the more complex methods such as the Minimum Descriptor length (MDL) criterion (Fenster et. al., 1993) and the Average of Rates (AOR) technique (Foster and Savage, 1989) show promise. However, linear regression has been found to be the best overall method by several researchers (Crowell, et. al., 1999; Crowell, et. al., 1997) and suggested to be the method of choice in some situations by others (Dean and Malakar, 1999; Dolan, et. al., 1991). Agreeing with their assessments, we elected to use linear regression for calculating projected future erosion hazard rates. The least-squares (LS) method is by far the most common method of linear regression and is the specific technique discussed in the literature referenced above. It works quite well for normally distributed data and has a number of statistical tests associated with it. However, the susceptibility of the LS method to outliers and point clustering or uneven point distribution is well documented with respect to shoreline change analysis (Fenster et. al., 1993).\\n---\\nDolan, et. al, 1991; Foster and Savage,1989). To help alleviate this problem Dolan, et. aI., 1991; Foster and Savage, 1989). To help alleviate this problem we used the reweighted least squares (RLS) regression method, described by Rousseeuw (1990) and outlined below. The first step involves identifying outliers using least median of squares (LMS) regression: Unlike the trend from LS regressions which can be thrown off by single bad data point; an LMS regression is very resistant to outliers, with breakdownPoint _ of 50%_. In other words, half of the data used in an LMS regression has to be contaminated before the trend is affected.\\n\\nBecause the LMS method does not explicitly deal with each data point, it is not considered to be analytical and does not include means t0 calculate statistics such as confidence limits. The RLS technique takes advantage of the robustness of LMS regression and the standardized statistical tests available for LS regression: It normalizes the LMS residuals by the estimated standard deviation. These standardized residuals, if larger than 2.5, are considered to be outliers. Outliers are assigned weight of zero, and the good data weight of one An LS regression is then fit that minimizes the weighted residuals in a least squares sense: It is essentially an LS regression on the \"good\" data only. We calculate uncertainties for RLS-derived erosion rates using the 80% confidence intervals for the slope suggested by Douglass et al. (1999). As mentioned above, there is a significant change in the shoreline trend for many transects Some, for example, show moderate trend of accretion followed abruptly by erosion Many researchers recommend using the longest available record for calculating erosion rates, provided there have not been physical changes in the system, Such as construction of coastal armoring or inlets opening or closing (Crowell; et. al. 1997; Crowell, et. aL., 1993; Dolan, et: al,, 1991; Leatherman and Crowell, 1997). It has also been pointed out, in particular by Fenster et; al. (1993), Morton (1991), and Foster andSavage (1989) , that an observed change in trend may in fact reflect fundamental change in the sediment dynamics of the system rather than short term fluctuation in the long term trend: This may be the case, whether or not a specific physical change can be cited to explain the change in shoreline trend. For the study site_ decision was made t0 use only the most recent trend in the data to calculate projected AEHRs The island has been experiencing of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) for the last several approximately 2.5 mm yr1 of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) for the last several Although local conditions frequently overwhelm the effect of RSLR at decadal timescales, net RSLR should at some point lead to shift in the armoring ofan extensive equilibrium position of the shoreline: Also_ the portion of the coastline resulted in artificial impoundment of coastal sand resources This contributes t0 sediment deficiencies on the shoreface, loss of the beach in front of these structures where there is net shoreline recession; and sediment starved system These physical attributes of the site dictate the need to use only data that reflect the current recessional nature of thecalculating AEHRs. Coastal Armoring number of measurement points overlay coastal during our photo coverageperiod. We frequently find the dry sandy beach fronting these structures has disappeared and did not reappear in subsequent photographs Data following the year when the beach first disaplpeared were discarded from erosion rate calculations Unless the remaining sandy will be scoured deeper shoreline trend reverses the profile - and the area will develop sand deficit A sand renourishment effort would 29] 291\\n---\\nthen require significant volume of sand to be added to the system before any dry beach at all could reappear:\\n\\nBeach width vegetation line and beach step crest are followed to Movements of both the vegetation line and beach step crest are followed to beack examine changes in beach width: Beach widths one measure of the well being sandy beach; are shown in Table 3 and d9ghlight the severity of the loss problem on Maui. Between 1949 and the mean beach width occurring between 1975 decreased by 55%, with the largest decrease, 3390, occurring between 1975 and 1988. The widespread construction of coastal armoring in the study site in the early 1970\\'s caused artificial impoundment of sediment landward of the structures and is primarily responsible for the decrease after 1975.\\n\\nWhen sub-cell gains sediment at the shoreface, it\\'s beachwidth increases, as can be seen in many instances in Table 3. If the accreted material remains there for several years it may stabilize the back beach area enough that the vegetation line will be able to move seaward. A similar time lag may occur vegetation line will when a beach is experiencing chronic erosion because the vegetation line will not move landward as rapidly as the beachstep crest (Morton and Speed, 1988). In an undisturbed system the beach will eventually return to its equilibrium width (Coyne et. al., 1996). Natural retreat of the vegetation line is often impeded in Hawaii by landscaping effforts of property owners (Fletcher et. aI., 1997) and contributes to long-term beach loss at the site.\\n\\n|Table 4|shows patterns of mean volume change or net sediment transport, by sub-cell and time interval: The northern half of the study site accreted 4.37|\\n|---|---|\\n| |\\'10\\' m\\' between 1900 and 1997 while the southern half lost 1.85 x 10\\' m\\' between 1900 and 1997. Within the reef-fronted portion of the site there was three times more accretion than erosion, despite erosion in the south that was quite severe in some areas. The South Kalama sub-cell lost about 50 x 10\\' m\" of sediment between 1912 and 1949 or 6.1 m\\' per alongshore meter of shoreline per year (i.e., -6_ m\\' m\" yr We speculate that some of the sediment eroded from the southern end of the study site was redeposited in the northern part by kona storm processes. Redeposition may have occurred as far south as the North Halama sub-cell, which accreted 1.4 m\\' m\" between 1912 and 1949. The area of overlap between the 1900 and 1912 T-sheets in the Kawililipoa sub-cell was already experiencing high accretion rates (6.7 m\" mI yr-I), suggesting that the area to the south was also experiencing erosion at this timesignificant coastal development in the area, prior to the onset of or other known anthropogenic factors that might contribute to coastal erosion.|\\n\\nThe \"hotspot\" of erosion at South Kalama gradually moved north, as seen in the shaded boxes in Table 4. As it migrated, areas close to the hotspot changed mode from eroding. By the late 1960s and especially the early 1970s, as erosion moved north, seawall and revetment construction followed. By artificially impounding coastal plain sediment, these structures cut off this sediment supply to the beach (Fletcher et. al., 1997), resulting in overall erosion and smaller rates of sediment transport throughout the site after 1975. Today the focus of erosion is in the North Halama sub-cell; almost 2 km north of its original location.\\n\\nA series of major kona storms between 1960 and 1963 caused general erosion during this time, especially on portions of the study site more significant exposed to southwesterly waves: The kona events also induced significant south-to-north longshore transport, at least 6.6 m as evidenced bv the impoundment of sediment; on the updrift side of the Halama groin in the 292\\n---\\nNorth Halama sub-cell. Concurrent erosion occurred on the downdrift side; North Halama sub-cell. Concurrent erosion occurred on the downdrift side, in the St Theresa sub-cell (see boxes outlined in bold in Table 4) the St. Theresa\\'s sub-cell (see boxes outlined in bold in Table 4). The walls of Koieie Fishpond show similar pattern during the 1960-1963 period of high kona storm activity, with the southern side accreting about 15 m while the north side eroded about 12 m: In 1900 however the situation extending about 90 m was reversed, with the shoreline north of the fishpond further seaward than the shoreline to the south: This suggests that the dominant longshore transport that shaped that part of the coast prior to 1900 was southerly. By 1997 the offset had been reduced to less than 15 m, while 200 m south of the fishpond the coastline has prograded 100 m seaward. The bulk of the accretion on the south side of the fishpond occurred between 1900 and 1949. Southwesterly kona storm waves move northward along the coast, but a similar high volume mechanism is not known to work in the opposite direction. Within Maalaea Bay on the leeward side of the island, the site is not exposed to large waves, except from the south and southwest: The limited fetch in Maalaea Bay north and northwest of the fishpond preclude the generation of large waves in the Bay itself that could move significant volumes of sediment to the south. Tradewind conditions however can and do move smaller volumes of sediment to the south within the site on a day-to-day basis. We hypothesize that the patterns of shoreline change reflect a dominant direction of longshore transport to the south that persisted for some significant period of time prior to 1900. The direction reversed, at least by 1912 and perhaps as early as shortly before 1900. We further speculate that some climatic shift, that perhaps affected the ratio of tradewind strength and persistence to kona storm activity, may be responsible and may be the simplest explanation that fits these observations. Ongoing research will investigate this hypothesis. Annual in situ sediment production, 530 m³, is small relative to the volume of sediment transported along the coast: It is only about 3% of the mean volume of sediment transported into or out of an average sub-cell over a single time interval. Over the 97-year period covered by the study, in situ production accounts for 18% of the net sediment accumulation. On time scales of years to a century, sediment transport processes are predominant shapers of the coastline. On scales of hundreds to thousands of years, however, sediment production is responsible for creating the beach and becomes a very important geologic process:\\n\\n## CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nMethodological Taken as a whole, we found the methods presented here to be an effective way to delineate and analyze shoreline changes on scales of years to a century. A faster way to complete photograph rectification would significantly enhance the overall process and is currently being investigated: The use of T-sheets to extend the period covered by the study greatly enhanced our understanding of the coastal processes and history, despite the greater uncertainty associated with the decrease in position control. No single erosion rate statistic was found to do an adequate job of characterizing past shoreline changes and projecting future erosion hazards in this area. The RLS method of linear regression was found to be more satisfactory than the more common LS regression for determining trends. Although returning very similar results in a majority of cases, the RLS method 293\\n---\\nwas more resistant to outliers while still allowing use of the same statistical tests available for LS regressions. Tracking of both the beach step crest and vegetation line made it possible to measure changes in beach width and use a two-term model for estimating volumetric change from historical shoreline positions. The model\\'s second term accounts for volume change of the vegetated coastal plain. In conjunction with the first term, which considers volume change of the sandy beach, this model is more accurate than the single-term version and useful for seasonal to century timescales.\\n\\nSeasonal fluctuation of the shoreline was quantified and found to be the largest consistent source of position uncertainty. Seasonal changes along the shoreline were found to be too random to be easily compensated and must be taken into account when calculating shoreline position error.\\n\\nWe agree with other investigators that, given the dynamic nature of the shoreline and temporal scarcity of shoreline position data, changes must be carefully analyzed. This is true for adequately characterizing past erosion rates, and especially for projecting future erosion hazard areas. Techniques used must be adapted for specific areas and data available.\\n\\nArea Specific: A major focus of erosion has been migrating northward along the coast, almost 2 km over the past 85 years. Unexpectedly, within the reef-fronted area forming the primary focus of our study, there has been three times more accretion in the northern part than erosion in the south. This behavior started prior to known significant human alteration of the system, and there has been net accretion, suggesting natural rather than anthropogenic forcing is primarily responsible. Climatic changes such as the ratio of tradewind to storm activity are hypothesized to be causative factors. Net erosion since 1975, and smaller rates of net sediment transport, are primarily due to anthropogenic impacts. Specifically, sediment impoundment landward of coastal armoring is contributing to a sediment-starved system, which has also resulted in a 55% decrease in beach width since 1949.\\n\\nFuture plans include expanding the study to include all the significant sandy shoreline areas on Maui. It is anticipated that comparison of changes between different areas will help to identify the major processes responsible for the dramatic changes that continue to occur along the coast of Maui.\\n\\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nThe authors thank Drs.

Pacific Island sedimentology provides an invaluable record of geomorphic and environmental consequences of coastal evolution in response to changes in sea level and local tectonics. A series of coastal auger cores obtained from eastern \\'Upolu reveal a subsurface carbonate sand envelope predominately composed of coral and coralline algae derived from the reef framework. Coupling the sedimentological record with geophysical models of Holocene sea level, we identify a critical value (0.3–1.0 m) during the falling phase of the sea-level high stand (1899–2103 cal yr BP) that represents the transition from a transgressive to a regressive environment and initiates coastal progradation. Correlating the critical value with time, we observe nearly a millennium of coastal plain development is required before a small human population is established. Our findings support previous studies arguing that Sāmoa was colonized by small and isolated groups, as post-mid-Holocene drawdown in regional sea level produced coastal settings that were morphologically attractive for human settlement. As future sea level approaches mid-Holocene high stand values, lessons learned from Pacific Island sedimentological records may be useful in guiding future decisions related to coastal processes and habitat suitability.\\n\\nKeywords: Sea level rise; Pacific Island; Carbonate sediments; Holocene high stand; Coastal evolution; Coastal stratigraphy; Sāmoa; Geoarchaeology; Island colonization; Critical elevation\\n\\n### INTRODUCTION\\n\\nUnderstanding the timing and influence of the mid-Holocene high stand is important for discerning the coastal evolution of the Pacific Islands (Grossman and Fletcher, 1998), interpreting early human migration and occupation histories (Allen, 1998; Rieth et al., 2008; Cochrane et al., 2013), and guiding decision making related to future sea-level rise (Dickinson, 2003; Goodwin and Grossman, 2003). Holocene sea-level change in the far-field region was initiated by eustatic sea-level rise (Lambeck et al., 2002) associated with the addition of glacial meltwaters and thermal expansion of seawater following the last ice age. In the Northern Hemisphere, melting ended approximately 5000–6000 yr BP (Alley and Clark, 1999).\\n\\n*Corresponding author at: Department of Geology and Geophysics, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, 1680 East-West Rd., POST Room 721, Honolulu, Hawaiʻi 96822, USA.

Woodroffe et al. REGIONAL SETTING (2012) argues that Holocene sea-level oscillations of a meter or greater are likely to have been produced by local rather than global processes. Thus, the timing and magnitude of the high stand varies between island settings because of localized uplift or subsidence (Dickinson, 2014) and distance from continental margins (Mitrovica and Milne, 2002). Previous studies estimate mid-Holocene sea level by identifying and dating emergent paleoshoreline features that formed within a restricted elevation range relative to the sea surface (Dickinson, 2001). Intertidal corals such as microatolls are believed to be the most precise sea-level indicators with an indicative range as low as 3 cm (e.g., Smithers and Woodroffe, 2000). Beachrock is often used as a paleo–tidal range indicator, and uncertainty can be reduced to half the tidal amplitude if the deposit can be referenced to the upper or lower intertidal zone (Mauz et al., 2015).\\n\\nCoastal plain sedimentology is often overlooked in mid-Holocene sea-level studies because carbonate sediments alone are not indicative of a precise relationship to former sea level (Goodwin and Grossman, 2003). However, the subsurface sedimentological record of high Pacific Islands is of value because it can be used to infer the geomorphic response and environmental consequences of coastal evolution in response to changes in sea level and local tectonics. Prior research has shown that as sea level falls following a high stand, carbonate sediment is stranded along the coastal plain and later buried by terrigenous sediment as the coastal plain progrades seaward (Calhoun and Fletcher, 1996). The subsurface carbonate unit thus preserves a record of the landward extent of marine transgression, supplementing prior estimates of high-stand sea level.\\n\\nPacific archaeologists have had a long-standing interest in the effects of sea-level drawdown and environmental habitability along coastal plains as exemplified by analyses at Tikopia, Solomon Islands (Kirch and Yen, 1982); Manu‘a Islands, Samoa (Kirch, 1993); Ha‘apai group, Tonga (Dickinson et al., 1994); Aitutaki, Cook Islands (Allen, 1998); and Mo‘orea (Kahn et al., 2014). Early in the drawdown phase of the high stand, some coastal landforms may have been less conducive to large populations and productive forms of staple food crops such as wetland taro (Colocasia esculenta) (Kirch, 1983; Spriggs, 1986; Quintus et al., 2015). Continued sea-level fall, however, eventually led to the expansion of sandy coastal flats characterized by increased size of coastal lowlands, eased coastal access, and low sloped environments more suited to larger human populations (Rieth et al., 2008; Cochrane et al., 2016). Building on prior archaeological studies, we provide a geologic reconstruction of ‘Upolu, Samoa’s (−14°1.2′S, −171°26.0′W; Fig. 1) coastal plain because of the unique potential to assess the impacts of differential subsidence and local variability of sea level across a single island. We define the value below which sea level must fall for a carbonate coast to prograde seaward as the critical value of sea level (Fig. 2A). The critical value initiates a regressive phase of island evolution, enabling the development of coastal landforms for a variety of human uses and settlement.\\n\\nSubsurface stratigraphy of the carbonate plain Two studies on the island of ‘Upolu, Samoa, focused on the post–mid-Holocene high-stand sedimentary sequence. Mulifanua (northwestern ‘Upolu; Fig. 2B), the oldest known Samoan settlement site (2880–2750 cal yr BP), was discovered submerged approximately 115 m offshore (Dickinson and Green, 1998; Petchey, 2001). A cultural midden layer was deposited on a thick (4.58 m thick) sandy beach that originally lay above sea level during the high stand. Following the high stand, local subsidence outpaced sea-level fall, and the surface of the beach became cemented into beachrock within the intertidal zone. Beachrock (0.75 m thick) currently extends up to the modern lagoon floor, preserving the underlying carbonate sand and cultural midden unit.\\n\\nBuilding on the work of Dickinson and Green (1998), Goodwin and Grossman (2003) analyzed coastal sedimentology along a shore perpendicular transect at Maninoa, southern ‘Upolu (Fig. 2C). Offshore, stranded beachrock is interpreted as a former carbonate beach that formed around the time of the mid-Holocene high stand (4699-4067 cal yr BP) (Goodwin and Grossman, 2003). Because the offshore beachrock is not emergent and instead is located within the modern intertidal zone, the authors concluded that southern ‘Upolu subsided since the high stand. In addition, the region is believed to have experienced expansive coastal plain progradation (50–100 m) between approximately 300 and 1000 cal yr BP in response to a slight lowering in relative sea level (Goodwin and Grossman, 2003).\\n---\\n## 248\\n\\nH.H. Kane et al.\\n\\nFigure 1. The central Pacific Island group of Sāmoa consists of three large, high volcanic islands (Savaiʻi, ʻUpolu, and Tutuila) and several smaller islands that are bordered in the southwest by the Tonga-Kermadec trench. Previous sea-level assessments in Sāmoa have focused largely on ʻUpolu Island, whereas the majority of relevant archaeology, paleoclimate, tropical cyclone, and tsunami assessments have been conducted at neighboring Pacific Islands.\\n\\nVertical shifts in island elevation approximated by the local tidal range (Mauz et al., 2015). Accounting for vertical shifts in island elevation in response to local or regional tectonism is necessary to accurately reconstruct paleo–sea level (Dickinson, 2001). Over time, shorelines may be vertically displaced because of a volcanic load creating lithospheric flexure (Pirazzoli and Montaggioni, 1988; Muhs and Szabo, 1994). For example, subsidence rates of the island of ʻUpolu (Mulifanua and Maninoa) were reestimated (Eq. 1) by Dickinson (2007) based on the elevation and age of beachrock (interpreted as a paleoshoreline indicator) at each site and a correction for ice age sea-level change (Mitrovica and Peltier, 1991) across each respective time period.\\n\\nSubsidence rate mm/yr = Elevation of dated beachrock (mm) + Sea-level (mm) Age (yr BP) (Eq:1)\\n\\nHowever, Dickinson (2007) underestimated the uncertainty associated with subsidence because his analysis only accounted for the 14C error associated with the dated material and ignored the vertical error associated with beachrock formation.

(A) We define the value below which sea level must fall for a carbonate coast to prograde seaward as the critical value of sea level. Following the 1–3 m modeled mid-Holocene high stand, coastal progradation at Satitoa was initiated as sea level fell beneath a critical value of 0.3–1.0 m (approximately 1899–2103 cal yr BP), and the coastal zone switched from a transgressive to a regressive environment.

The historical record of storms and tsunamis should be investigated so that correlations between the sedimentological record and these catastrophic saltwater events may be made or ruled out. For example, in the region surrounding ʻlthou, Sāmoa, five tsunamis with a maximum water height of 3 m or greater and eight category 2 cyclones or greater have been documented since 1868. In both Sāmoa and Tuvalu, cyclone banks as large as 2–3 m high, 50 m wide, and 2 km long formed by large storm waves that dredged coral debris from the fore reef and reef crest and deposited them as far as 10–20 m shoreward onto the reef flat where they were reworked and moved shoreward by subsequent wave action. In addition, both tsunamis and storm waves can transport and deposit coral boulders along the coastal plain.\\n\\nBecause Holocene sea-level studies typically extend beyond the historical record, an understanding of the potential for paleotsunamis and paleostorms is pertinent for interpretation of coastal stratigraphy.

The reference survey descriptions such as texture, depth of sediment horizons, and the presence of datable coral clasts were recorded at each core location. Two surface grab samples were recovered from the Satitoa reef flat and the modern beach face at Taufua beach (~2.20 km to the southwest).

Because the tidal relationship between the Satitoa village study site and the Apia tide gauge is not established, the surveyed elevations were referenced to local low water observed at the toe of the Satitoa shoreline. Low water positions were adjusted to MSL using the average low tide recorded at the Apia tide station on the days that topographic data were collected (http://www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org/).

(2000), carbonate sand samples were sieved through eight grain-size classes according to the Wentworth (1922) scale, and mean grain size and sorting index were calculated using Folk and Ward (1957). Coral clasts and two surface sediment samples were submitted to the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for 14C radiocarbon dating. Coral clasts selected for dating had uniform characteristics: minimal recrystallization, spatial representation of the study area, and constrained at the top and base of the cored carbonate layer. Coral clasts were pretreated for dating with ultrasonic washing and acid etching, and radiocarbon ages were corrected for the regional marine reservoir effect using CALIB version 7.1 and the Marine13 calibration data set (Stuiver and Braziunas, 1993; Reimer et al., 2013; http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib/calib.html).\\n\\nA compositional analysis of the carbonate sand layer was performed to determine the origin and relative percentage of skeletal, nonskeletal, and unidentifiable grains (Harney et al., 2000). Skeletal grains included coral, coralline algae, Halimeda, mollusc, benthic foraminifera, and echinoderm fragments. Nonskeletal sediment includes intraclasts and crystalline/volcanic grains. Carbonate sediments were Figure 4. Relative percentage of reef-derived skeletal sediment, nonskeletal sediment, and unidentifiable materials (origin could not be determined). Surface samples were collected within the reef flat and Taufua beach, and subsurface carbonate samples were obtained from cores 4, 5, 13, 14, and 15.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn general, the stratigraphy of the coastal plain reveals an abrupt contact between the surface loam and underlying carbonate sand (Fig. 3). Carbonate sand extends inland as far as 200 m and is typically found between 1.34 m and –0.71m relative to MSL. Thickness varies from 0.58m to 1.80 m; however, because of difficulty in coring, most cores were not able to fully penetrate the sandy carbonate unit. The basal carbonate units typically did not contain rip-up clasts, included both intact and fragmented marine shells, and were thicker (0.48–1.51m) than both the modern tsunami deposits recorded at ‘Upolu and paleotsunami deposits of Futuna Island. Three cores (3, 9, and 10) encountered a second carbonate layer (<25cm thick) at the surface of the core, which may be interpreted as a deposit of the 2009 South Pacific tsunami. The landward cores of each transect are typically composed entirely of loam or clay, with the exception of transect D, which is bordered on the landward extent by a thickly vegetated marsh. Surface sand content diminishes in the south (transect E), and cores are capped with clay loam.\\n---\\n## 252\\n\\nH.H. Kane et al.\\n\\nThe subsurface carbonate unit generally fines upward 150–200 m from the modern shoreline. The remaining coral (66.7% of cores) and contains poorly to very poorly sorted, coarse to very coarse sand at the base. The seaward cores (9 and 10) and core 17 are an exception. Cores 9 and 10 contain a massive medium sand layer that is moderately well to poorly sorted, and core 17 fines upward with the exception of a very poorly sorted medium sand layer at the base of the core. Cores 3, 9, and 10 have a second carbonate sand unit at the surface that is characterized by moderately well to poorly sorted, fine to medium sand. Modern beach and reef flat sediment samples are characterized by coarse sand that is moderately well and poorly sorted, respectively.\\n\\nCored sands contained isolated coral clasts, marine shells (Monetaria moneta), and carbonate concretions. The subsurface carbonate unit was dominated by skeletal grains, with unidentifiable grains accounting for 2%–12% of total composition (Fig. 4). Coral and coralline algae derived from the reef framework are the dominant sources of sediment, representing ≤42.0% of total composition. Core 13 was found to have a lower relative percentage of reef-derived components and a higher combined percentage of in situ calcareous organisms such as benthic foraminifera, Halimeda, molluscs, and echinoderms.\\n\\nAll calibrated 14C ages presented in Table 1 may be referenced with respect to distance from the shoreline and elevation relative to MSL. Core 5 (3150–3346 cal yr BP) and core 9 (1949–2151 cal yr BP) contain the two oldest dates and are found near the surface of the carbonate layer and relatively close to the modern shoreline. There is a general trend of increasing age with depth for those samples collected.\\n\\n### DISCUSSION\\n\\nNumerous studies throughout the central Pacific equatorial region provide evidence of emergent shorelines formed by the mid-Holocene high stand (Calhoun and Fletcher, 1996; Fletcher and Jones, 1996; Allen, 1998; Grossman et al., 1998; Dickinson, 2001), yet coastal plain sedimentology is often overlooked because coral clasts and sands are not indicative of a precise relationship to former sea level (Goodwin and Grossman, 2003). The true value of the subsurface carbonate unit is that it records the landward extent of marine transgression, and when correlated with time using modeled sea-level curves, we can determine a timeline for shoreline regression. For example, at Satitoa the coastal plain prograded seaward approximately 200 m beginning as early as 2000 cal yr BP. Holocene sea-level curves for ʻUpolu (Fig. 5) were computed using a theory of ice age sea-level change (Alley and Clark, 1999) that incorporates the full deformational, gravitational, and rotational perturbations to the Earth system driven by ice melt and ocean meltwater loading (Kendall et al., 2005). The calculations require, on input, models for the ice history across the last glacial cycle and the depth variation of 95.4% (2σ) cal age ranges (cal yr BP).\\n\\n|Lab ID|Site|Distance from shoreline (m)|MSL elevation (m)|Material dated|14C age (14C yr BP)|Cal age ranges (cal yr BP)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|TMB|MB|0|0|CS|475 ± 20|905–1056|\\n|SML|RF|-27.8|0|CS|1880 ± 25|1306–1500|\\n|P105-D3|5|100.56|0.43–0.77|CC|3410 ± 20|3150–3346|\\n|P106-D4|6|170.35|0.33–0.53|CC|1420 ± 20|867–1039|\\n|P106-D6|6|170.35|0.06–0.15|CC|1550 ± 20|976–1169|\\n|P109-D4|9|26.29|1.04–1.19|CC|2450 ± 20|1949–2151|\\n|SAT1-S5|SAT1|192.90|0.33–1.05|CC|1380 ± 15|799–963|\\n|P104-D6|4|63.71|-0.02–0.12|CC|1990 ± 20|1406–1606|\\n|P104-D9|4|63.71|-0.37 to -0.27|CC|1420 ± 20|867–1039|\\n|P111-D5|11|135.42|-0.60 to -0.49|CC|2400 ± 20|1899–2103|\\n|P113-D5|13|196.24|0.08–0.51|CC|1760 ± 20|1219–1357|\\n|P113-D6|13|196.24|-0.07–0.08|CC|1720 ± 20|1173–1310|\\n|SAT3-D7|SAT3|196.24|-0.53 to -0.50|CC|1670 ± 15|1133–1277|\\n|P115-D4|15|70.47|0.67–1.04|CC|1640 ± 20|1081–1259|\\n|P115-D5|15|70.47|0.12–0.67|CC|1440 ± 20|894–1045|\\n|P117-D7|17|138.89|0.12–0.27|CC|1320 ± 20|750–915|\\n|SAT1b|SAT1|192.90|1.13–1.30|Cnn|523 ± 20|612–619 (2%) 512–554 (93.4%)|\\n|Core 8b|Core 8|192.90|1.07–1.52|UIC|607 ± 20|580–652 (75.3%) 549–571 (20.1%)|\\n\\na Material dated: CC, coral clast; Cnn, Cocos nucifera nutshell; CS, carbonate sand; UIC, unidentified charcoal.\\n\\nb Samples SAT1 (1.13–1.30 m depth) and Core 8 were originally published in Cochrane et al.

Prior high-intensity events are known to remove and transport large sediment loads (silt size to coral boulders) from the reef crest to the beach and coastal plain. We acknowledge periodic redeposition by high-energy events as a research problem and call on the importance of analyzing both the instrumental record and geologic record of tsunami and tropical cyclones when interpreting the stratigraphic record of Pacific Islands. For example, the 1860–2000 cal yr BP paleotsunami recorded at nearby Futuna Island could have eroded and deposited sediment at the base of our carbonate unit, and the younger 470 cal yr BP event could have reworked sediment near the surface. High-energy punctuated events could also be responsible for our two oldest dates, which we interpret as outliers. Core 9 (1949–2151 cal yr BP) represents the closest core to the present marine environment, and core 5 (3150–3346 cal yr BP) is at least 1000 yr older than any other dated material.\\n\\nDated bulk surface sediments from the beach and reef flat suggest that coastal sand-sized sediment may remain in transport for approximately 900–1500 yr, which is not uncommon for the Pacific Islands. In bioclast-rich environments, there is inherently a temporal uncertainty associated with radiocarbon ages because beach sediment originates from the progressive destruction of reef framework limestone and calcifying organisms. In future experiments, the age of the coastal plain can be constrained more accurately by dating individual, delicate or spiny foraminifera such as Calcarina and Baculogypsina spaerulata as the ages of these specimens are more reflective of deposition and burial soon after death.\\n\\nThe Holocene sea-level models incorporated in this study assume lateral uniformity in mantle viscosity, and as a result, continental margins and midocean environments are described by the same mantle rheology parameters. We acknowledge this as a flaw in the current state of these models because of the limited distribution of island data and the poor viscosity within the Earth model.\\n\\nFigure 5. Dated core material is plotted together with three Holocene sea-level curves computed using the coupled ice history and mantle viscosity models: ICE 5G-VM2, ICE 6G-VM5, and ANU-LM (see text). Cultural dates were obtained from the sandy loam cultural layer described by Cochrane et al. (2015), and all other dates originate from subsurface coral clasts or surface carbonate sand. The sedimentary record is plotted here with the modeled sea-level curves not to confirm the accuracy of the modeled sea-level record or to reconstruct Holocene shoreline migration, but rather to constrain a time period for the initiation and growth of the sandy coastal plain. Coastal plain progradation initiated 1899–2103 cal yr BP and continued until approximately 549–652 cal yr BP when the unit became buried by the cultural loam layer. Because the base of the carbonate unit was not dated, the reported dates may represent a minimum age for coastal progradation.\\n\\nVariations in modeled ice history and viscosity affect the timing and amplitude of the high stand. For example, the viscosity models VM2 and VM5 are characterized by a relatively weak lower mantle (<3 × 10^21 Pa s), significantly lower than the value in model LM (2 × 10^22 Pa s). Thus, coupling the sedimentary record with the modeled sea-level curves does not confirm the accuracy of the geophysical record, but rather we can conclude that coastal progradation at Satitoa occurred nearly two to four millennia after the mid-Holocene high stand. As sea level fell below a critical sea-level value of 0.3–1.0 m, the rate of deposition of marine sediments exceeded the rate of erosion along the coast.\\n\\nAn understanding of the vertical shifts in island elevation in response to local or regional tectonism is necessary to accurately account for the magnitude of sea-level change, as well as the timing of subsequent coastal evolution. We argue that differential subsidence rates at ʻUpolu result not only in variations of relative sea level but also the timing at which the coastal plain recovers from an erosive state and begins to\\n---\\n254\\n\\nH.H. Kane et al.\\n\\nresolution of depth dependence of viscosity for islands Change Fifth Assessment Report predicts by the end of the century, under a worst-case scenario (RCP8.5), that equatorial Pacific regions may experience sea-level values 10%–20% above the global mean of 0.74 ± 0.23 m (Church et al., 2013). Coastal plain evolution recorded in the sedimentary record of volcanic islands reveals the timing and extent of marine transgression as Holocene sea level approached values similar to future projections. In addition, model projections also forecast increased South Pacific Convergence Zone migration and increased extreme El Niño and La Niña events in response to global warming (Cai et al., 2012, 2014, 2015). Thus, overlaid on the long-term rise in sea level may be periods of increased probability for extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones. The impacts of short-term catastrophic events such as storms and tsunamis will be further exacerbated by future sea-level rise.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nCoastal plain stratigraphy is often overlooked in paleo–sea-level reconstructions because carbonate sediments do not precisely constrain former sea level. Here we show that Pacific Island sedimentology provides an invaluable record of geomorphic and environmental consequences of coastal evolution in response to changes in sea level and local tectonics. Coastal evolution in response to prior changes in sea level is of particular interest because the late Holocene fall in sea level is believed to have played a dominant role in the availability of suitable coastal habitats where early human populations were typically found. A series of auger cores obtained from eastern ‘Upolu reveal that as sea level falls following a high stand, carbonate sediment derived from the destruction of the offshore reef framework is stranded along the coastal plain and subjected to periodic erosion and redeposition by punctuated high-energy events such as tsunamis and tropical cyclones. When interpreting coastal sediments, it is important to have some understanding of the historical context of the timing and impacts of tropical cyclones and tsunamis so that uncertainties related to interpretations of the sedimentological record may be reduced. In addition, to accurately reconstruct the magnitude of relative sea level and the timing of coastal progradation across larger volcanic islands, it is necessary to account for vertical shifts in island elevation in response to local or regional tectonism. For example, we show that a lag in seaward growth along the southern coast of ‘Upolu may be related to higher relative sea-level rates resulting from increased subsidence rates closer to the volcanic load on Savaiʻi.\\n\\nImplications of coastal evolution on past and future societies\\n\\nCoastal plain evolution is of particular interest to the permanent settlement and migrations of the first Pacific Island peoples because no single factor has influenced coastal environments more than sea-level fluctuations (Allen, 1998). Prior studies have argued that because of the low gradient of most coastal plain environments, the rate of future sea-level rise impact will rapidly accelerate once the height of the sea surface exceeds a critical elevation (Kane et al., 2015). Using this same logic, we reason that habitable coastal environments may not evolve until the sea level falls below a critical value that allows for the rapid development of suitable coastal flats. For example, at the nearby Sāmoan islands of Tutuila and Aunuʻu it has been argued that permanent settlement prior to approximately 2500 cal yr BP was limited because of the lack of suitable sandy coastal flats related to less settlement space, coastal access, and higher slope under elevated sea level (+2.0 m) (Rieth et al., 2008). A cultural layer with sparse anthropogenic deposits found directly on top of the carbonate sands at Satitoa, ‘Upolu, was dated and provides a terminus ante quem of 549–652 cal yr BP for the marine carbonate unit (Cochrane et al., 2016). Thus, it is not until ~500 cal yr BP (Cochrane et al., 2016), more than a millennium after coastal progradation began, that the coastal zone stabilized and anthropogenic deposits indicative of a small population along eastern ‘Upolu appear. Our findings support previous studies that suggest that post–mid-Holocene drawdown in regional sea level produced coastal settings that were morphologically attractive for human settlement (Dickinson, 2001; Rieth et al., 2008; Cochrane et al., 2013; Burley and Addison, 2015).\\n\\nA better understanding of coastal plain evolution since the fall of the mid-Holocene sea-level high stand may guide decisions related to coastal communities affected by future sea-level rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\\n\\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. University of Hawaii at Manoa Library, on 26 Jun 2017 at 22:52:14, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/qua.2017.2\\n---\\nCoastal plain stratigraphy records tectonic, environmental, and human habitability with time, we observe that nearly a millennium of coastal plain development is further required before a small population is established. The framework by which a critical value of sea level may be used to better constrain the timing and development of morphologically attractive coastal settings for human settlement is relevant throughout the far-field Pacific as the mid-Holocene sea-level high stand was a regionally prominent geophysical event that shaped the coastal plain of thousands of islands. Thus, we conclude that as sea level rises into the future, approaching mid-Holocene high-stand values, lessons learned from the Pacific Island sedimentological record may be useful in guiding future decisions related to coastal processes and habitat suitability. Future sea-level rise will once again exceed a critical value, and the rate and extent of flooding will rapidly accelerate across the coastal plain. By coupling future sea-level rise models with local topography, decision makers may begin to develop a timeframe by which they may plan for the largest impacts of sea-level rise.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nMahalo e Satitoa village, Matiu Matavai Tautunu, Joseph Mills, Alexander Morrison, and Ralph Moberly.

However, sea-level rise threatens the work of resource managers because coastal erosion, salt-water intrusion, and flooding degrade critical habitats. Because habitat loss is a measure of the risk of extinction, managers are keen to receive guidelines and other tools to reduce the risk posed by sea-level rise. Extending upon standard inundation mapping techniques and suitability mapping, we develop a ranking system that models sea-level rise vulnerability as a function of six input parameters defined by wetland experts: type of inundation, time of inundation, soil type, habitat value, infrastructure, and coastal erosion. To exemplify the method, the model is applied to three coastal wetlands on the Hawaiian islands of Maui and O‘ahu. Each ranked input parameter is mapped upon a 2 m horizontal resolution raster and final vulnerability is obtained by calculating the weighted geometric mean of the input vulnerability scores. Areas that ranked with the ‘highest’ vulnerability should be the focus of future management efforts. The tools developed in this study can be used as a guide to prioritize conservation actions at flooded areas and initiate decisions to adaptively manage sea-level rise impacts.\\n\\nKeywords: sea level rise, expert judgment, adaptive management, wetlands, Hawaii, vulnerability\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nGlobally, coastal strand and wetland habitats have high conservation value due to the role they play in the preservation of endangered and endemic organisms. Wetlands provide a variety of functions that reduce storm damage and stabilize shorelines (Gedan et al. 2011), trap land-based sediments, retain nutrients, and alleviate flooding (Bruland 2008). In the Pacific region alone, over 2,500 islands and atolls harbor a diverse range of freshwater, coastal, and marine wetlands (Ellison 2009). It is noted that the disappearance of small wetlands will cause a dire reduction in the ecological connection among remaining species populations (Semlitsch and Bodie 1998).\\n\\nSea-level rise (SLR) is a growing problem on low lying coastal plains and threatens costal strand and wetland habitats with increased erosion (Romine et al. 2013), frequency of extreme high water events (Tebaldi et al. 2012), pond water levels, and salinity (Kuan 2012). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report predicts under a worst case (RCP8.5) scenario, global sea-level for the year 2100 is likely to increase 0.53 to 0.98 m relative to 1986-2005 (Church et al. 2013). Equatorial Pacific regions may experience sea-level values between 10-20% above the global mean (IPCC 2013). Islands within the tropics are especially\\n---\\nvulnerable because species have narrow tolerances for changes in climate (Mora et al. 2013), and microtidal (< 2 m tidal range) environments do not allow for large concentrations of marine suspended sediment to aid in vertical accretion in response to SLR (Kirwan et al. 2010).\\n\\nTo date, the majority of insular SLR vulnerability research has focused on summarizing potential impacts on a global scale (e.g. Wetzel et al. 2012; Bellard et al. 2013). For example, Bellard et al. (2013) found that approximately 6% of the 4,447 islands investigated worldwide would be entirely submerged under 1 m of SLR. Global assessments are beneficial for demonstrating the general consequences of SLR, however through the use of low resolution elevation data sets, the final vulnerability maps are produced with large errors (Cooper et al. 2013b). Furthermore most management occurs at regional and local scales, thus fine-scale vulnerability assessments are more relevant for direct decision making (Halpern et al. 2007).\\n\\nPrior regional scale assessments define SLR vulnerability based upon uncertainty in high-resolution elevation along with tidal datums (Gesch 2013) and SLR estimates (Cooper and Chen 2014), or as a balance between vertical accretion potential and the changing rate of SLR (e.g. Kirwan and Temmerman 2009; Kirwan et al. 2010; Morris et al. 2011). However within highly managed areas such as Hawaiian wetlands, landscape vulnerability should relate to the site-specific goals of decision makers. A number of studies have ranked the vulnerability of marine ecosystems to anthropogenic threats based on survey results of experts (e.g. Halpern et al. 2007; Fuentes and Cinner 2010; Selkoe et al. 2008). In addition to quantifying impacts suitability mapping is another approach to visually represent the priorities of wetland managers. Van Lonkhuyzen et al. (2004) and White and Fennessy (2005) generate suitability maps of potential wetland mitigation and restoration sites. Integrating expert elicitation with suitability mapping in a GIS would allow decision makers with site-specific goals to evaluate landscape vulnerability due to future SLR. To our knowledge, no studies to date utilize an approach that couples expert elicitation with suitability mapping in a GIS to systematically evaluate coastal habitat vulnerability to future SLR.\\n\\nWe present an approach to prioritizing management strategies in response to SLR based upon a number of predetermined factors such as the time and nature of flooding, environmental features that influence flood severity, and the loss that would result from flooded high value habitats and infrastructure. The vulnerability ranking process may be easily refined and replicated to other small, microtidal islands to accommodate different planning needs, data availability, and sources of expert knowledge.\\n---\\n## Methods\\n\\nThe modeling approach used in this study to assess SLR vulnerability is outlined in Figure 1. Study sites were identified based upon the biological integrity of managed resources within an area, the existence of experienced and knowledgeable management staff, and the availability of mappable layers such as high resolution topographic data (Fig. 1a). We defined vulnerability from a management perspective by mapping those parameters that best characterize how SLR will impact decision makers’ ability to accomplish mandated goals and objectives (Fig. 1b). A literature search and elicited expert knowledge were used to rank vulnerability parameters for each study site from very high (5) to very low (1) (Fig. 1c). We used a GIS to apply the ranked vulnerability scores and a weighted geometric mean to map the cumulative vulnerability (Fig. 1d-f). Areas with the highest vulnerability were identified and should be used to guide adaptive management planning (Fig. 1g-h). Wetland experts may modify the model and refine the definition of vulnerability as new information becomes available (Fig. 1i).\\n\\n## Study area\\n\\nIn conjunction with the Hawai‘i Wetland Joint Venture, a group that represents state, federal, and local wetland managers, three low lying coastal environments were identified: James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge (north O‘ahu), Kanaha Pond State Wildlife Sanctuary (north Maui), and Keālia Pond National Wildlife Refuge (south Maui). The refuges are composed three dominant environments including coastal wetlands, a coastal strand, and upland habitats. The wetlands consist of freshwater impoundments and natural ponds that are fed by groundwater, and rainfall. The wetlands are largely buffered from marine flooding and sediment inputs by a narrow coastal strand and 2-4 m sand dunes (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011a). The refuges provide habitats for the recovery of endangered waterbirds, the endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi), the threatened Hawaiian green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), seabirds, and migratory shorebirds. Identified at each study site were one to two senior wetland experts who from training, research, and personal experience (5-20+ years) possess the greatest capacity to assess how SLR will impact future management strategies.\\n\\n## Defining sea-level rise vulnerability\\n\\nHere, we define SLR vulnerability as having primary and secondary parameters. Through discussions with local wetland managers it was expressed that they are primarily concerned with prioritizing management at flooded areas upon the value of each site. The primary parameters are defined by 1) type of inundation, 2) time of inundation, and 3) habitat value. For type of inundation a wetland manager’s ability to manage impacts due to\\n---\\n## marine inundation (surface flooding from the ocean), and groundwater inundation (associated with rising water\\n\\ntables) is compared. For time of inundation, a wetland manager’s planning horizon or his/her ability to create and\\n\\nemploy long-term adaptive management strategies in response to potential impacts is assessed. For habitat value, an\\n\\ninventory of the emphasis that is placed upon management of key species within a coastal strand, wetland, and\\n\\nupland habitat is created.\\n\\n## The secondary parameters refine the definition of threatened resources based upon the availability of\\n\\nancillary data. Secondary parameters are defined by 1) soil type, 2) community infrastructure, and 3) coastal erosion\\n\\nhazard zones. Soil type was used to identify high salinity, and poor draining, hydric soils that may act as ponding\\n\\nareas for floodwaters. The infrastructure parameter was used to identify regions within the managed bounds that if\\n\\ninundated, may flood surrounding community infrastructure. The coastal erosion parameter modeled the landward\\n\\nmigration of future shorelines under elevated sea-level.\\n\\n## 2.3 Ranking vulnerability parameters\\n\\nExpert judgment was used to rank the primary vulnerability parameters defined in section 2.2. Face to face\\n\\nsurveys were conducted and experts were asked a series of questions where they ranked the vulnerability of their\\n\\nrefuge to SLR from very low (1) to very high (5) (Table 1). After each survey question, respondents were asked to\\n\\nuse the same ranking scale to indicate how confident they were about the depth of knowledge used to determine\\n\\nvulnerability (Halpern et al. 2007; Selkoe et al. 2008; Fuentes and Cinner 2010). Assessing survey confidence gives\\n\\ngreater importance to values with higher certainty (Halpern et al. 2007), and allows for gaps in knowledge to be\\n\\nidentified (e.g. low confidence responses). Equation 1 defines vulnerability input rank as the summed product of\\n\\nvulnerability score and confidence, divided by the sum of the confidence.\\n\\nVulnerability Input Rank = Vulnerability Score × Confidence / Confidence (Equation 1)\\n\\nSecondary input parameters were ranked by the authors, and relied on data collected from a literature\\n\\nreview. Secondary ranks were based upon the presence and intensity of the identified parameters. Secondary input\\n\\nparameters and their ranks are explained in more detail in the following section.\\n\\n## 2.4 Mapping vulnerability\\n\\nGIS layers for each input parameter were compiled, and 2 m horizontal resolution rasters were produced\\n\\nsuch that each cell represented a corresponding vulnerability rank (Table 1). To map type (groundwater vs. marine)\\n---\\n## 1\\n\\nand time (0.30 m of SLR by 2057, and 0.74 m by 2100) of inundation, SLR inundation maps were generated by interpolating LiDAR ground returns as a 2 m horizontal resolution LiDAR DEM. The LiDAR data has a vertical uncertainty of 0.18-0.20 m (1) and was collected in geographic coordinates and ellipsoid heights relative to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Ellipsoid elevations were transformed to orthometric elevations using the Geoid03 model, before they were finally adjusted to the Local Tidal Datum of MSL.\\n\\n## 2\\n\\nTo assess the percent probability that a location is inundated we accounted for the uncertainty of the LiDAR data and the SLR model estimates. The IPCC’s fifth assessment report (AR5) Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) model provides yearly global mean sea-level and associated uncertainty (1) values up until the year 2100. A cumulative percent probability approach, similar to NOAA (2010), and also used by Mitsova et al. (2012) was carried out to calculate a standard-score (SS xy) or the number of standard deviations a value differs from the mean.\\n\\nSS xy / s z 2 2 (Equation 2)\\n\\nThe standard-score was calculated through a cell by cell approach where the difference between the projected sea-level value above MHHW (s) and the DEM elevation (z) was divided by the joint-uncertainty of SLR projections (s) and LiDAR data (z). The standard score was converted to a percent probability via a look-up table. Similar to Cooper and Chen (2013c) the probability rasters were reclassified by assigning the range of probability values 0-0.49 equal to 0 (not inundated), 0.50-0.79 equal to 50 (low probability), and 0.80-1 equal to 80 (high probability).\\n\\n## 3\\n\\nOne of the key issues for managing wetlands is identifying which areas may be impacted by marine (salty) inundation or groundwater (potentially fresh or brackish) inundation as waterfowl and vegetation are sensitive to both increased pond water levels and salinity (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011a, 2011b). To determine areas of marine inundation, DEM grid cells hydrologically connected to the ocean were identified using the 8-sided connectivity approach. This approach identifies those flooded cells that are either directly adjacent to the ocean or connected to the ocean via adjacent grid cells in the cardinal and diagonal directions (Cooper et al. 2013b; Poulter and Haplin 2008). Inundated areas disconnected from the ocean were assumed to be flooded by rising groundwater levels (Rotzoll and Fletcher 2012). Wetland experts ranked the vulnerability of their study area to both types of\\n---\\ninundation by considering natural and constructed features that may impede future surface inundation, as well as their dependency upon groundwater sources to maintain pond water levels.\\n\\nThe ability of highly managed ecosystems to successfully adapt to SLR lies in the capacity of coastal decision makers to develop and implement long-term adaptive management plans. The time of inundation parameter ranked wetland managers’ ability to implement strategies to manage 0.30 m of SLR by 2057, and 0.74 m of SLR by 2100. IPCC’s RCP8.5 global SLR model was used to correlate sea-level heights with time (Church et al. 2013). Due to time and human resource restraints most refuges do not have the capacity to plan for long-term processes that can’t be quickly remediated in the short-term (10-15 years) time frame that they typically plan for. Thus as a decision maker’s ability to adaptively respond to the threats of SLR diminishes, managed resources become increasingly vulnerable to SLR.\\n\\nTo assess the ecological value of coastal sites that may potentially be flooded by SLR, experts were asked to rank the emphasis that is placed upon the management of a list of predetermined species within mapped coastal strand, wetland, and upland habitats. Managed areas that have a high habitat value were ranked highly vulnerable to SLR because these areas will result in the greatest loss in endangered and native organisms if impacted by SLR. For example, globally, coastal strand habitats are managed to support important nesting sites for sea turtles (Fuentes and Cinner 2010), resting areas for monk seals (Baker et al. 2006), and winter staging sites for migrant shorebirds (Galbraith et al. 2002). Wetland areas delineated by the National Wetlands Inventory (http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Mapper.html) are managed primarily to provide habitat for Hawai‘i’s four endemic and endangered waterbirds. Upland habitats are defined as the non-wetland or coastal strand area.\\n\\nThe presence of hydric soils is one of the primary indicators used to identify the occurrence of historical wetlands, as well as potential areas to support the establishment of future wetland ecosystems (Richardson and Gatti 1999; Van Lonkhuyzen et al. 2004; White and Fennessy 2005). Poorly drained and moderately to strongly saline hydric soil types were identified in each study area using soil maps derived from the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) web soil survey (http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/). Hydric soils included Kealia silt loam, Kaloko clay, Keaau clay, and Pearl Harbor clay. Due to the low draining potential of hydric soils, we assumed that areas with hydric soils are very highly vulnerable to prolonged flooding, whereas non-hydric soil areas have a very low vulnerability.\\n---\\n## Coastal and Wetland Management\\n\\nCoastal and wetland managers have a commitment to mitigate flood impacts upon both refuge and surrounding community infrastructure (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011a, 2011b). To assess the proximity of flooded areas to infrastructure, a 50 m buffer was mapped around three infrastructure types:\\n\\n- Roads\\n- 2010 U.S. census designated urban areas (http://planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data/)\\n- Rural areas (http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/ccapregional)\\n\\nFlooded areas that intersect buffered infrastructure were ranked very highly vulnerable because refuge flooding may impact the nearby community.\\n\\nWe modeled the effects of accelerated Sea Level Rise (SLR) on beaches with a hybrid model that extrapolated the long-term trend from historical shoreline data collected by the University of Hawaii Coastal Geology Group (Fletcher et al. 2013), and added the change in shoreline positions due to accelerated SLR by employing the Bruun Rule (Bruun 1962) using the difference between projected and current SLR. The Bruun Rule, although criticized, provides first approximations to SLR-induced shoreline response in limited settings. With no other viable alternative, the hybrid model extends the Bruun Rule to account for the local sediment budget which often largely influences shoreline change in Hawaiian settings (Norcross et al. 2002).\\n\\nErosion hazard zones mapped in this study encompass the area occupied between the current shoreline and the future shoreline position predicted under a 0.74 m rise in sea-level at the year 2100. Hazard zones projected from sandy shorelines are ranked very highly vulnerable to SLR, while those projected from hardened shorelines are ranked moderately vulnerable.\\n\\n## Identifying High Vulnerability Areas\\n\\nOnce each of the individual vulnerability parameters were ranked (Table 1) and mapped (Fig. 2a-f), cumulative vulnerability was determined. The final spatial variation of vulnerability for each study area was found by combining the individual vulnerability parameter rasters using a weighted geometric mean (Equation 3).\\n\\nFinal Vulnerability\\n(type * time * habitat * soil * infrastructure * erosion) / 9 (Equation 3)\\n\\nThis approach is mathematically similar to the wetland suitability modeling methodology used by Van Lonkhyzen et al. (2004). Primary input parameters (type, time, and habitat) were ranked higher than secondary parameters (soil, infrastructure, and erosion) because the primary input parameters most directly reflect manager’s goals and objectives.\\n---\\n## Results and discussion\\n\\nIncreases in pond water height and salinity directly impact managers’ ability to provide suitable habitat for endangered waterbirds. Assuming a 0.74 m rise in sea-level we found that groundwater inundation represents over 90% of the total inundation at all study areas (Table 2). Recent studies have argued that sea-level could very likely exceed 1 m by the end of the century (e.g. Horton et al. 2014; Kopp et al. 2014), which could potentially cause an increased frequency and intensity of marine flooding as sea-level breaches sand dunes, narrow outlet ditches, dikes and other natural coastal buffers. At James Campbell, wetland managers believed it would be more difficult to pump wetlands to alleviate increased groundwater inputs, while at Keālia, salty hydric soils are currently impacting waterbirds and vegetation.\\n\\nWith the exception of James Campbell, experts expressed a moderate to very low ability to manage mid and end of the century impacts according the RCP8.5 SLR projections. Our analysis revealed that the bulk of inundation at James Campbell (94.7% of surface area) is projected to occur in the second half of the century (Table 2). This coincides with a time period when wetland managers believe they are most vulnerable to SLR.\\n\\nMapped wetland habitat types were found to be the most important habitats due to the role they play in preservation of endangered waterbirds, and were ranked highly vulnerable to SLR. At James Campbell and Keālia, coastal strand habitats ranked second based upon the priority each refuge gives to the management of native coastal plants, the monk seal, and sea turtles. At Kanaha, upland habitats are valued as potential sites to relocate wetland habitats.\\n\\nPoor draining, high salinity, hydric soils occupy relatively large areas at James Campbell and Keālia. The hydric soil layer at these two study areas includes both existing wetlands and surrounding upland areas which may in the future be prone to long periods of standing water due to poorly drained soils. Kahana was the only study area that lacked hydric soils.\\n\\nOn the basis of infrastructure alone, the areas of the highest vulnerability are located near refuge infrastructure or along the refuge boundaries that are bordered by community infrastructure. As the number of community infrastructure types increases there is a greater risk that flooding within the refuge will impact bordering roads, urban, and rural communities. This is especially true at Kanaha, which is located in downtown Kahului, Maui and is completely surrounded by development. Accounting for land and building values in Kahului, an independent study by Cooper et al. (2013a) found that a 0.75 m rise in sea-level would result in a loss of $18.7 million dollars.\\n---\\n#### Keālia\\n\\nThe majority of infrastructure is located on the narrow coastal strip and is bordered on both sides by inundation.\\n\\nAll three study areas are currently experiencing chronic coastal erosion (Fletcher et al. 2013). Two out of the three study areas have roads, houses and other developed structures that will prevent the natural landward migration of beaches as sea-level rises and potentially limit the availability of coastal habitats.\\n\\nComposite vulnerability scores were compiled and the areas with the highest vulnerability rank were identified. At all three study areas, the dominant factor in determining vulnerability is whether or not an area is inundated, which is an artifact of the weighting scheme that was applied. Wetland managers, however, may find it useful to prioritize management efforts at flooded areas and thus the other input parameters were applied. Keālia most successfully exemplifies the applicability of this methodology. Figure 2g illustrates both the areas predicted to be inundated by 2100 (blue) as well as a subset of the inundated areas that ranked a higher vulnerability (yellow and red). Referring to our input vulnerability maps (Fig. 2a-f), the areas of highest vulnerability are defined as inundated hydric soil wetlands and the eroded coastal strand that fall within 50 m of infrastructure. At Keālia, infrastructure serves as the distinguishing feature in determining high vulnerability, as the majority of the flooded area encompasses wetlands habitat and hydric soils. At Kanaha high vulnerability areas are defined as inundated wetlands, uplands and coastal stand habitats that fall within the erosion hazard zone (Online Resource 1). High vulnerability areas at James Campbell are defined as inundated coastal strand environments within the erosion hazard zone, and inundated wetlands with hydric soil (Online Resource 2).\\n\\n#### Conclusions\\n\\nUnder changing climate conditions it will be increasingly difficult to achieve all conservation objectives for habitats, species and protected areas (Hossell et al. 2003). This study is unique in that it couples expert knowledge and empirical data to define and map input parameters that systematically rank SLR vulnerability. The ranking process is translated into a series of maps that identify high vulnerability areas where adaptive management efforts are needed most. The entirety of this process should encourage discussion of how managing high priority or high vulnerability areas will impact current management objectives and goals. For example coastal decision makers should identify low lying areas and discuss how management of these areas may be impacted by marine and groundwater sources of flooding. Creating an inventory of infrastructure, valued habitats, and cultural assets that fall within the predicted areas of flooding may assist in prioritizing which flooded habitats to manage first.\\n---\\n## We acknowledge that various management groups or regions have different goals and objectives. The strength of this approach is that the rankings as well as the input parameters and data can be updated to include new sources of information and refine results from this analysis. We recommend that the primary input parameters be employed in all aspects of this methodology, however the secondary vulnerability parameters are interchangeable and can be altered to reflect the availability of data and needs of the user. It is important to note that the quality of model output is a function of the quality of input data, and expert knowledge. Vertical error of a DEM has the largest influence on defining areas of inundation (Gesch 2013; Zhang 2011), and it is recommended that LiDAR data be used by decision makers to identify high-resolution hazard zones (Cooper et al. 2013b).\\n\\n## The expert knowledge elicitation process greatly benefits from face-to-face surveys that allow input parameters to be adequately defined or updated so that they are truly beneficial in determining rank. This process encourages decision makers to feel more confident in focusing resources to manage these ‘high vulnerability’ areas. Our study employed a small sample size due to limited management staff at each study site. Rather than consulting a larger group of experts who may have a general idea of how each coastal ecosystem functions, wetland managers found it more beneficial to sample a smaller number of experts who have in-depth knowledge of site specific characteristics, historical factors, and management goals of each coastal environment.\\n\\n## The greatest gap in knowledge arose when defining long-term plans from the perspective of climate science models and wetland experts. SLR is a relatively slow process, and the majority of impacts, with the exception of seasonally flooded wetlands, are predicted and modeled for the second half of the century. Wetland experts cite the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Comprehensive Conservation Plans as the extent of current long-term planning. These documents provide specific management guidance for each national wildlife refuge system over a period of 15 years (e.g. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011a, 2011b). Wetland experts attributed their limited ability to plan further into the future to the uncertainty in future funding, limited staff coupled with a high number of daily responsibilities and the lack of pressure in the past to plan for longer time periods. There is a great need to extend the planning horizon of wetland resource managers and to improve SLR modeling and mapping products. Encouraging scientists and managers to work closely together may ensure that scientific products are relevant to their use in decision making.\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\n---\\n## This project was supported by the U.S. Department of Interior Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative grant # 6661281, the School of Ocean Earth Science and Technology, and the Native Hawaiian Student Engineering Mentorship Program.\\n\\n### Figure Captions\\n\\n|Fig. 1|Depiction of the vulnerability ranking process.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Fig. 2|Example vulnerability maps for Keālia National Wildlife Refuge.

Because habitat loss is a measure of the risk of extinction, managers are keen for guidance to reduce risk posed by sea-level rise. Building upon standard inundation mapping techniques and suitability mapping, we develop a ranking system that models sea-level rise vulnerability as a function of six input parameters defined by wetland experts: type of inundation, time of inundation, soil type, habitat value, infrastructure, and coastal erosion. We apply this model under the mid-century and end-of-century RCP8.5 sea-level projection (0.30 m by 2057, and 0.74 m by 2100) according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. To demonstrate this method, the model is applied to three coastal wetlands on the Hawaiian islands of Maui and O‘ahu. Each ranked input parameter is mapped upon a 2 m horizontal resolution raster and final vulnerability is obtained by calculating the weighted geometric mean of the input vulnerability scores. Areas that ranked with the ‘highest’ vulnerability should be the focus of future management efforts. The tools developed in this study can be a guide to prioritize conservation actions at flooded areas and initiate decisions to adaptively manage sea-level rise impacts.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nGlobally, coastal strand and wetland habitats have high conservation value due to the role they play in the preservation of endangered and endemic organisms. Wetlands provide a variety of functions that reduce storm damage and stabilize shorelines (Gedan et al. 2011), trap land-based sediments, retain nutrients, and alleviate flooding (Bruland 2008). In the Pacific region alone, over 2500 islands and atolls harbor a diverse range of freshwater, coastal, and marine wetlands (Ellison 2009). It is noted that the disappearance of small wetlands will cause a dire\\n\\nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10584-015-1377-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\\n\\nH.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) predicts under a worst-case scenario (RCP8.5), global sea-level will increase 0.30±0.08 m by 2057 (mid-century) and 0.74±0.23 m by 2100 relative to 1986–2005 (Church et al. 2013). Equatorial Pacific regions may experience sea-level values between 10 and 20% above the global mean (IPCC 2013). Islands within the tropics are especially vulnerable because species have narrow tolerances for changes in climate (Mora et al. 2013), and microtidal (<2 m tidal range) environments do not allow for large concentrations of marine suspended sediment to aid in vertical accretion in response to SLR (Kirwan et al. 2010).\\n\\nTo date, much of insular SLR vulnerability research has focused on summarizing potential impacts on a global scale (e.g., Wetzel et al. 2012; Bellard et al. 2013). For example, Bellard et al. (2013) found that approximately 6% of the 4447 islands investigated worldwide would be entirely submerged under 1 m of SLR. Global assessments are beneficial for demonstrating the general consequences of SLR, however through the use of low-resolution elevation datasets, the final vulnerability maps are produced with large errors (Cooper et al. 2013b). Furthermore, most management occurs at regional and local scales, thus fine-scale vulnerability assessments are more relevant for direct decision making (Halpern et al. 2007).\\n\\nPrior regional scale assessments define SLR vulnerability based upon uncertainty in high-resolution elevation along with tidal datums (Gesch 2013) and SLR estimates (Cooper and Chen 2013). However, within highly managed areas such as Hawaiian wetlands, landscape vulnerability should relate to the site-specific goals of decision makers. Previous studies have gained stakeholders\\' support by ranking the vulnerability of marine ecosystems to anthropogenic threats based on survey results of experts (e.g., Halpern et al. 2007; Fuentes and Cinner 2010; Selkoe et al. 2008). These studies employ an expert elicitation process that involves synthesizing experts\\' opinion of relative impacts and assessing the uncertainty of those views (Halpern et al. 2007; Fuentes and Cinner 2010). Expert knowledge is used both in instances when data is scarce, and to supplement empirical data (Hameed et al. 2013). To aid in the prioritization of conservation actions, those ecosystem threats that are identified as having the greatest impact generally are dealt with first (Fuentes and Cinner 2010).\\n\\nMost threat ranking studies to date include SLR in an array of multiple stressors and do not provide maps that spatially represent areas assumed to experience the greatest impacts. Previous studies have generated suitability maps that use ranked variables to identify potential wetland mitigation and restoration sites (Van Lonkhuyzen et al. 2004; White and Fennessy 2005). Integrating expert elicitation with suitability mapping in a GIS would allow decision-makers with site-specific goals to evaluate landscape vulnerability due to future SLR.\\n\\nWe present an important case study that depicts a localized approach to prioritizing management strategies in response to SLR based upon a number of predetermined factors such as the time and nature of flooding, environmental features that influence flood severity, and the loss that would result from flooded high-value habitats and infrastructure. The vulnerability ranking process may be easily refined and replicated to other small, microtidal islands to accommodate different planning needs, data availability, and sources of expert knowledge.\\n---\\n## Author\\'s personal copy\\n\\nClimatic Change\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\nThe modeling approach used in this study to assess SLR vulnerability is outlined in Fig. 1.\\n\\nStudy sites were identified based upon the biological integrity of managed resources within an area, the existence of experienced and knowledgeable management staff, and the availability of mappable layers such as high resolution topographic data (Fig. 1a). We defined vulnerability to future SLR of 0.30 m by 2057 and 0.74 m by 2100 (Church et al. 2013) from a management perspective by mapping those parameters that best characterize how SLR will impact decision makers’ ability to accomplish mandated goals and objectives (Fig. 1b). A literature search and elicited expert knowledge were used to rank vulnerability parameters for each study site from very high (5) to very low (1) (Fig. 1c). We used ArcGIS 10.2 to apply the ranked vulnerability scores and a weighted geometric mean to map the cumulative vulnerability (Fig. 1d–f). Areas with the highest vulnerability were identified and should be used to guide adaptive management planning (Fig. 1g–h). Wetland experts may modify the model and refine the definition of vulnerability as new information becomes available (Fig. 1i).\\n\\n### 2.1 Study area\\n\\nIn conjunction with the Hawai‘i Wetland Joint Venture, a group that represents state, federal, and local wetland managers, three low lying coastal environments were identified: James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge (north O‘ahu), Kanaha Pond State Wildlife Sanctuary (north Maui), and Keālia Pond National Wildlife Refuge (south Maui). The refuges are composed of three dominant environments including coastal wetlands, a coastal strand, and\\n\\n|Community|N|James Campbell|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Biological|O`ahu|Kanaha|\\n|Elevation| |Keālia|\\n\\nMappable layers\\n\\n| |Biological Integrity|Experts|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Type of inundation|Primary|Very high|\\n|Time- planning horizon|Very low|Expert rank|\\n|Habitat value| |Literature review|\\n|Soil type|Secondary| |\\n|Community infrastructure|Very high|Very low|\\n|Coastal erosion| | |\\n\\nType\\n\\nTime\\n\\nHabitat\\n\\nSoil\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\nErosion\\n\\nFig. 1 Depiction of the vulnerability ranking process\\n---\\n## Author\\'s personal copy\\n\\nClimatic Change upland habitats. The wetlands consist of freshwater impoundments and natural ponds that are fed by groundwater, and rainfall. The wetlands are largely buffered from marine flooding and sediment inputs by a narrow coastal strand and 2–4 m sand dunes (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011a). The refuges provide habitats for the recovery of endangered waterbirds, the endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi), the threatened Hawaiian green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), seabirds, and migratory shorebirds. Identified at each study site were one to two senior wetland experts (four experts total) who from training, research, and personal experience (5–20+ years) possess the greatest capacity to assess how SLR will impact future management strategies.\\n\\n## Defining sea-level rise vulnerability\\n\\nHere, we define SLR vulnerability as having primary and secondary parameters. Through discussions with local wetland managers it was expressed that they are primarily concerned with prioritizing management at flooded areas upon the value of each site. The primary parameters are defined by 1) type of inundation, 2) time of inundation, and 3) habitat value. The secondary parameters refine the definition of threatened resources based upon the availability of ancillary data. Secondary parameters are defined by 1) soil type, 2) community infrastructure, and 3) coastal erosion hazard zones.\\n\\n## Ranking vulnerability parameters\\n\\nExpert judgment was used to rank the primary vulnerability parameters defined in Section 2.2. Face to face surveys were conducted and experts were asked a series of questions where they ranked the vulnerability of their refuge to SLR from very low (1) to very high (5) (Table 1). After each survey question, respondents were asked to use the same ranking scale to indicate how confident they were about the depth of knowledge used to determine vulnerability (Halpern et al. 2007; Selkoe et al. 2008; Fuentes and Cinner 2010). Assessing survey confidence gives greater importance to values with higher certainty (Halpern et al. 2007), and allows for gaps in knowledge to be identified (e.g., low confidence responses). Equation 1 defines vulnerability input rank as the summed product of vulnerability score and confidence, divided by the sum of the confidence.\\n\\n|Vulnerability Score|Confidence|\\n|---|---|\\n|X|Confidence|\\n\\nSecondary input parameters were ranked by the authors, and relied on data collected from a literature review. Secondary ranks were based upon the presence and intensity of the identified parameters. Secondary input parameters and their ranks are explained in more detail in the following section.\\n\\n## Mapping vulnerability\\n\\nGIS layers for each input parameter were compiled, and 2 m horizontal resolution rasters were produced such that each cell represented a corresponding vulnerability rank (Table 1). SLR inundation maps were generated by interpolating LiDAR ground returns as a 2 m horizontal resolution LiDAR DEM. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) contracted Airborne 1 in 2006 to collect LiDAR data for Keālia, while LiDAR at James Campbell and\\n---\\n|Parameter|Weight|James Campbell|Keālia|Kanaha|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Type of inundation|2| | | |\\n|Groundwater|5|4|4|4|\\n|Marine|4|5|5|4|\\n|Not inundated|1|1|1|1|\\n|Time of inundation|2| | | |\\n|2057 (0.30 m)|2|4|3| |\\n|2100 (0.74 m)|3|4|5| |\\n|Not inundated|1|1|1| |\\n|Habitat value|2| | | |\\n|Coastal strand|4|3|2| |\\n|Upland shrub/forest|2|2|3| |\\n|Wetlands|5|5|5| |\\n|Soil type|1| | | |\\n|Hydric|3|3|None| |\\n|Non-hydric|1|1| | |\\n|Community infrastructure|1| | | |\\n|3 types|5|5|5| |\\n|2 types|4|4|4| |\\n|1 type|3|3|3| |\\n|None|1|1|1| |\\n|Coastal erosion|1| | | |\\n|Erosion hazard|5|5|5| |\\n|Hardened shoreline|3|None|3| |\\n|None|1|1|1| |\\n---\\nThe standard-score was calculated through a cell by cell approach where the difference between the projected sea-level value above MHHW (μ s) and the DEM elevation (μ z) was divided by the joint-uncertainty of SLR projections (σ s) and LiDAR data (σz). The standard score was converted to a percent probability via a look-up table. Similar to Cooper and Chen (2013) the probability rasters were reclassified by assigning the range of probability values 0– 0.49 equal to 0 (not inundated), 0.50–0.79 equal to 50 (low probability), and 0.80–1 equal to 80 (high probability).\\n\\nOne of the key issues for managing wetlands is identifying which areas may be impacted by marine (salty) inundation or groundwater (potentially fresh or brackish) inundation as water-fowl and vegetation are sensitive to both increased pond water levels and salinity (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011a, b). To determine areas of marine inundation, DEM grid cells hydrologically connected to the ocean were identified using the 8-sided connectivity approach. This approach identifies those flooded cells that are either directly adjacent to the ocean or connected to the ocean via adjacent grid cells in the cardinal and diagonal directions (Cooper et al. 2013b; Poulter and Haplin 2008). Inundated areas disconnected from the ocean were assumed to be flooded by rising groundwater levels (Rotzoll and Fletcher 2012). Wetland experts ranked the vulnerability of their study area to both types of inundation by considering natural and constructed features that may impede future surface inundation, as well as their dependency upon groundwater sources to maintain pond water levels.\\n\\nThe ability of highly managed ecosystems to successfully adapt to SLR lies in the capacity of coastal decision makers to develop and apply adaptive management plans. The time of inundation parameter ranked wetland managers’ ability to implement strategies to manage 0.30 m of SLR by 2057, and 0.74 m of SLR by 2100. The IPCC’s RCP8.5 scenario was used to correlate mean sea-level heights with time (Church et al. 2013). Due to time and human resource restraints most refuges do not plan beyond 10– 15 years into the future (e.g., USFWS 2011a, b). Thus as a decision maker’s ability to adaptively respond to the threats of SLR diminishes, managed resources become increasingly vulnerable to SLR.\\n\\nTo assess the ecological value of coastal sites that may potentially be flooded by SLR, experts were asked to rank the emphasis that is placed upon the management of a list of predetermined species within mapped coastal strand, wetland, and upland habitats. Managed areas that have a high habitat value were ranked highly vulnerable to SLR because these areas will result in the greatest loss in endangered and native organisms if impacted by SLR. For example, globally, coastal strand habitats are managed to support important nesting sites for sea turtles (Fuentes and Cinner 2010), resting areas for monk seals (Baker et al. 2006), and winter staging sites for migrant shorebirds (Galbraith et al. 2002). Wetland areas delineated by the National Wetlands Inventory (http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Mapper.html) are managed primarily to provide habitat for Hawai‘i’s four endemic and endangered waterbirds. Upland habitats are defined as the non-wetland or coastal strand area.\\n\\nThe presence of hydric soils is one of the primary indicators used to identify the occurrence of historical wetlands that no longer exist due to changes in hydrology and vegetation, as well as potential areas to support the establishment of future wetland ecosystems (Richardson and Gatti 1999; Van Lonkhuyzen et al. 2004; White and Fennessy 2005). Poorly drained and moderately to strongly saline hydric soil types were identified in each study area using soil maps derived from the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) web soil survey (http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/). Hydric soils included Kealia silt loam, Kaloko clay, Keaau clay, and Pearl Harbor clay. Due to the low draining potential of hydric soils, we assumed that areas with hydric soils are very highly vulnerable to prolonged flooding, whereas non-hydric soil areas have a very low vulnerability.\\n---\\nClimatic Change\\n\\nCoastal and wetland managers have a commitment to mitigate flood impacts upon both refuge and surrounding community infrastructure (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011a, b). To assess the proximity of flooded areas to infrastructure, we mapped a 50 m buffer around three infrastructure types including roads, 2010 U.S. census designated urban areas (http://planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data/), and rural areas (http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/ccapregional). Flooded areas that intersect buffered infrastructure were ranked very highly vulnerable because refuge flooding may impact the nearby community.\\n\\nWe modeled the effects of accelerated SLR on beaches with a hybrid model that extrapolated the long-term trend from historical shoreline data collected by the University of Hawaii Coastal Geology Group (Fletcher et al. 2013), and added the change in shoreline positions due to accelerated SLR by employing the Bruun Rule (Bruun 1962) using the difference between projected and current SLR. The Bruun Rule has been highly criticized (Thieler et al. 2000; Cooper and Pilkey 2004) due to its limiting assumptions (e.g., closed sediment system, offshore-only transport), yet field and laboratory studies have argued that the Bruun Rule does provide first approximations to SLR-induced shoreline response in limited settings (Hands 1979; Mimura and Nobuoka 1995; Zhang et al. 2004). With no other viable alternative, we use the hybrid model to extend the Bruun Rule to account for the local sediment budget which often largely influence shoreline change in Hawaiian settings (Norcross et al. 2002). Erosion hazard zones mapped in this study encompass the area occupied between the current shoreline and the future shoreline position predicted under a 0.74 m rise in sea-level at the year 2100. Hazard zones projected from sandy shorelines are ranked very highly vulnerable to SLR, while those projected from hardened shorelines are ranked moderately vulnerable.\\n\\nIdentifying high vulnerability areas\\n\\nOnce each of the individual vulnerability parameters were ranked (Table 1) and mapped (Fig. 2a–f), cumulative vulnerability was determined. The final spatial variation of vulnerability for each study area was found by combining the individual vulnerability parameter rasters using a weighted geometric mean (Eq. 3).\\n\\nFinal Vulnerability\\ntype2 time2 habitat2 soil infrastructure erosion\\n9\\n(Eq. 3)\\n\\nThis approach is mathematically similar to the wetland suitability modeling methodology used by Van Lonkhuyzen et al. (2004). Primary input parameters (type, time, and habitat) were ranked higher than secondary parameters (soil, infrastructure, and erosion) because the primary input parameters most directly reflect manager’s goals and objectives.\\n\\nResults and discussion\\n\\nFor several reasons future sea level position is uncertain. This study uses the global mean values of RCP8.5 to map mid-century (0.3 by 2057) and end of the century (0.74 by 2100) impacts of SLR. We chose RCP8.5, the IPCC AR5 worst case scenario, because recent studies have argued that sea-level could very likely exceed 1 m by the end of the century (e.g., Horton et al. 2014; Kopp et al. 2014). Regional assessments (e.g., Slangen et al. 2012; Spada et al. 2013; IPCC 2013) of SLR provide estimates for the departure of the central Pacific (Hawai‘i’s location) from the global average. For example, by the year 2100 the tropical Pacific is predicted to reach a sea-level value between 10 and 20% above the global mean (IPCC 2013). In our study we apply global SLR rates to Hawai‘i because regional models fail to\\n---\\nAuthor\\'s personal copy\\n\\nClimatic Change\\n\\nNet irunoaleo MC nurduled Uclario Const Sol lYpanrdrcen sincilgn vulnerablily inuijatau 3i698 nan coniidcns Jncalad arras (D 7 niuhejnfcence Guniinenca\\n\\nFig. 2 Example vulnerability maps for Keālia National Wildlife Refuge.

The greatest gap in knowledge arose when defining long-term plans from the perspective of climate science models and wetland experts. Wetland experts typically do not plan beyond 15 years into the future due to limited staff coupled with a high number of daily responsibilities, and uncertainty in future funding. In addition much of the uncertainty in SLR projections is irreducible and stakeholders are challenged with making decisions given greater long-term uncertainty. On the other hand, current vertical uncertainty associated with LiDAR and datum errors makes it difficult to generate accurate inundation maps using short-term SLR planning targets (Cooper et al. 2013b). We suggest a compromise such as the rolling short-term (approx.\\n---\\n|Type of inundation|High confidence (80%)| |Low confidence (50%)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Study Area|% Area|% Total inundation|% Area|% Total inundation|\\n|James Campbell|Groundwater|1.4|93.2|8.2|98.2|\\n| |Marine|0.1|6.8|0.2|1.8|\\n|Kanaha|Groundwater|25|99.1|4.4|97.1|\\n| |Marine|0.2|0.9|0.1|2.9|\\n|Keālia|Groundwater|27.6|98|11.7|98.3|\\n| |Marine|0.6|2|0.2|1.7|\\n|James Campbell|2057 (0.30 m)|0.1|5.6|0.7|7.9|\\n| |2100 (0.74 m)|1.5|94.7|8.3|92.7|\\n|Kanaha|2057|24.9|98.7|0.2|3.9|\\n| |2100|0.3|1.3|4.5|96.1|\\n|Keālia|2057|21.9|77.7|3.4|22.4|\\n| |2100|6.3|22.3|11.8|77.6|\\n---\\nAuthor\\'s personal copy\\n\\nClimatic Change\\n\\nOn the basis of infrastructure alone, the areas of the highest vulnerability are located near refuge infrastructure or along the refuge boundaries that are bordered by community infrastructure. As the number of community infrastructure types increases there is a greater risk that flooding within the refuge will impact bordering roads, urban, and rural communities. This is especially true at Kanaha, which is located in downtown Kahului, Maui and is completely surrounded by development. Accounting for land and building values in Kahului, Cooper et al. (2013a) found that a 0.75 m rise in sea-level would result in a loss of $18.7 million dollars. At Keālia the majority of infrastructure is located on the narrow coastal strip and is bordered on both sides by inundation.\\n\\nAll three study areas are currently experiencing chronic coastal erosion (Fletcher et al. 2013). Two out of the three study areas have roads, houses and other developed structures that will prevent the natural landward migration of beaches as sea-level rises and potentially limit the availability of coastal habitats. Coastal erosion and sea-level extreme events may be exacerbated by increased storminess and associated storm surges, however limited geographical coverage of current studies and the uncertainties related to future storminess, prevents a local assessment of impacts (IPCC 2013).\\n\\nComposite vulnerability scores were compiled and the areas with the highest vulnerability rank were identified. At all three study areas, the dominant factor in determining vulnerability is whether or not an area is inundated, which is an artifact of the weighting scheme that was applied. Wetland managers, however, may find it useful to prioritize management efforts at flooded areas and thus the other input parameters were applied. Keālia most successfully exemplifies the applicability of this methodology. Figure 2g illustrates both the areas predicted to be inundated by 2100 (blue) as well as a subset of the inundated areas that ranked a higher vulnerability (yellow and red). Referring to our input vulnerability maps (Fig. 2a–f), the areas of highest vulnerability are defined as inundated hydric soil wetlands and the eroded coastal strand that fall within 50 m of infrastructure. At Keālia, infrastructure serves as the distinguishing feature in determining high vulnerability, as the majority of the flooded area encompasses wetlands habitat and hydric soils. At Kanaha high vulnerability areas are defined as inundated wetlands, uplands and coastal stand habitats that fall within the erosion hazard zone (Online Resource 1). High vulnerability areas at James Campbell are defined as inundated coastal strand environments within the erosion hazard zone, and inundated wetlands with hydric soil (Online Resource 2).\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nUnder changing climate conditions it will be increasingly difficult to achieve all conservation objectives for habitats, species and protected areas (Hossell et al. 2003). This study is unique in that it couples expert knowledge and empirical data to define and map input parameters that systematically rank SLR vulnerability. The ranking process is translated into a series of maps that identify ‘high vulnerability’ areas where adaptive management efforts are needed most. The entirety of this process should encourage discussion of how managing ‘high priority’ or’ high vulnerability’ areas will impact current management objectives and goals. For example coastal decision makers should identify low lying areas and discuss how management of these areas may be impacted by marine and groundwater sources of flooding. Creating an inventory of infrastructure, valued habitats, and cultural assets that fall within the predicted areas of flooding may assist in prioritizing which flooded habitats to manage first.\\n\\nThe expert knowledge elicitation process greatly benefits from face-to-face surveys that allow input parameters to be adequately defined or updated so that they are truly beneficial in\\n---\\nAuthor\\'s personal copy\\n\\nClimatic Change determining rank. This process encourages decision makers to feel more confident in focusing resources to manage ‘high vulnerability’ areas. Our study employed a small sample size due to limited management staff at each study site. Rather than consulting a larger group of experts who may have a general idea of how each coastal ecosystem functions, wetland managers found it more beneficial to sample a smaller number of experts who have in-depth knowledge of site specific characteristics, historical factors, and management goals of each coastal environment.\\n\\nThe strength of this approach is that the rankings as well as the input parameters can be tailored to reflect the goals and objectives of various management groups and regions. As regional projections of SLR, storminess, and storm surge improve they can be incorporated into the vulnerability model to refine the designation of ‘high vulnerability’ areas. Currently there is much uncertainty surrounding future sea-level position. Thus, the real world adaptive challenge is to make decisions given great long-term uncertainty. Flexible, adaptive management strategies that identify gaps in knowledge, develop alternative hypothesis, and gradually revise policies in response to new scientific findings and observations are necessary to produce management plans that openly address an uncertain future.\\n\\nAcknowledgments This project was supported by the U.S. Department of Interior Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative grant # 6661281, the School of Ocean Earth Science and Technology, and the Native Hawaiian Student Engineering Mentorship Program.\\n\\n## References\\n\\nBaker JD, Littnan CL, Johnston DW (2006) Potential effects of sea level rise on pe terrestrial habitats of endangered and endemic megafauna in pe Norpwestern Hawaiian Islands.

West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Hawai‘i’s beaches are a focal point of modern lifestyle as well as cultural tradition. Yet coastal erosion threatens areas that have served as burial grounds, home sites, and other forms of cultural significance. To improve understanding of the convergence of erosion patterns and cultural uses, we mapped shoreline changes from Kawela Bay to Kahuku Point on the capital island of O‘ahu. Shoreline change rates are calculated from historical photographs using the single-transect (ST) and eigenbeaches (EX) method to define the 50- and 100-year erosion hazard zones. To ensure that shoreline change rates reflect long-term trends, we include uncertainties attributable to natural shoreline fluctuations and mapping errors. A hazard zone overlay was compared to cultural data provided by the Hawaii State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD) and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) to identify threats to cultural features. Cultural features identified in the study include iwi kupuna (burials), Hawaiian artifacts, and Punaulua (a freshwater spring). Our analysis indicates that, except for Punaulua, all cultural features identified are vulnerable to coastal erosion at historical rates. The data produced in this study may be used as a proactive management tool to rank the vulnerability to threatened cultural features, as well as to develop protocols to appropriately manage cultural assets.

On O‘ahu, the capital island of Hawai‘i, 60% of all beaches are experiencing long-term erosion with an average rate of 20.06 ± 0.01 m/y (Fletcher et al., 2011). In addition approximately 8% or 8.7 km of O‘ahu’s beaches have been lost to erosion. Furthermore, sea-level rise will likely cause erosion to expand and accelerate. Hawai‘i’s shoreline management system awards coastal dunes to counties and awards beaches to the state (Fletcher et al., 2010). Counties focus on planning and permitting, while the state Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) has a mandate to conserve public lands. Within the DLNR, the Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands oversees submerged lands (beaches and seafloor), and the State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD) preserves historic burials and artifacts. Communication between the various agencies that manage the shoreline may be hindered because of conflicting mandates, which ultimately challenges management efficacy. Knowing beforehand the areas that might be threatened by coastal erosion can be an effective planning tool in this context. In Hawai‘i and other Pacific Islands, coastal lands vulnerable to erosion may contain cultural features such as iwi kupuna (burials), historical artifacts, ancient home sites, and magnificent physical features. In addition to the multiple agencies that manage the shoreline the process is further complicated because of the lack of consistent management protocol to deal with erosion threats to cultural assets. Thus it is not uncommon for the public to unknowingly mistreat cultural features exposed by erosion. Romine et al. (2009) and Hapke et al. (2010) defined a methodology for determining shoreline change rates and uncertainty at the littoral cell scale; however, identifying chronic erosion threats to cultural deposits requires higher resolution. This study demonstrates methodology for identifying chronic erosion threats to cultural assets by identifying erosion hazard zones based upon shoreline change rates and uncertainties at individual shoreline transects. Cultural features that fall within the erosion hazard zones may be potentially threatened by erosion, thus highlighting the need for specific management planning.\\n\\nDOI: 10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00114.1 received 27 June 2011; accepted in revision 16 September 2011.

Hawaiian burials are especially prevalent in coastal areas because dunes have historically served as important burial sites. Hawaiians place a high value on protocol with respect to the treatment of iwi kupuna because they believe that when a Hawaiian passes the mana, or one’s divine power, the soul remains with the iwi kupuna (K. Markell, personal communication, 2009).\\n\\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\\n\\nMapping Historical Shorelines\\n\\nWe followed the methods of Romine et al. (2009), Fletcher et al. (2003), and Rooney et al. (2003) for mapping historical shoreline positions and calculating positional uncertainties. To identify erosion and accretion trends, historical shorelines are digitized from 0.5 m orthorectified aerial photo mosaics and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Ocean Service (NOAA NOS) topographic survey maps (T-sheets) (Romine et al., 2009). A low water mark (LWM) position or ‘‘beach toe’’ is used as a shoreline proxy. Nine to 11 historical shorelines are available for the study area dating from 1910–2007. Two beaches in the study area have been significantly altered by coastal engineering. For this reason we do not include historical shorelines prior to that event in our analysis. In the early 1970s construction of the Turtle Bay Resort resulted in the removal of natural vegetation, diversion of a stream, and sand mining at Kalokoiki Beach (transects 119–125). After reviewing imagery at Kawela Bay Beach, it was observed that a stream mouth (transects 28–32) was removed between the 1967 and 1971 images. At both Kalokoiki beach and the portion of Kawela Bay beach mentioned previously, shorelines prior to 1971 are removed from the time series, and rates are calculated to best represent the subsequent shoreline change.\\n\\nSeven sources of uncertainty are included in the shoreline change models to account for the natural variability of shoreline positions (e.g., waves, tides) as well as mapping errors (e.g., image resolution). These sources of error include Digitizing Error (Ed), Pixel Error (Ep), Seasonal Error (Es), Rectification Error (Er), Tidal Fluctuation Error (Etd), T-sheet Plotting Error (Ets), and T-sheet Conversion Error (Etc). Total positional uncertainty (Et) is the root sum of squares (RMS) of individual errors. The total positional uncertainty in this study ranged from 5.68–14.13 m and is applied as a weight for each shoreline position by the shoreline change models that use weighted least square regression.\\n\\nThe Ed results from the analysts’ interpretation of the shoreline position that is digitized from aerial photographs. Ed is determined by taking the standard deviation (SD) of the differences in the shoreline positions digitized from a group of experienced operators working on a sample area of shoreline (1.44–5.14 m). Ep, or pixel size, refers to the resolution of our orthophoto mosaics (0.5 m) and T-sheets (3 m); Es, or seasonal change, is accounted for through the use of summer and winter beach profiles for 8 years at Sunset Beach, located to the west of the study area (Gibbs et al., 2001; C.H. Fletcher, B.M. Romine, and M. Dyer, unpublished data, 2008). The seasonal change is the difference between LWM positions along a shore-perpendicular transect between summer and winter (4.49 m). Er is an RMS error that is calculated because of the misfit of the shoreline position.\\n\\n## STUDY AREA\\n\\nThe study area is located on the north coast of the capital island of O‘ahu. The study area extends from Kawela Bay to Kahuku Point, covering approximately 4.3 km of sandy shoreline. Three sections in particular, Kawela Bay, Turtle Bay, and Kahuku Point, are former settlements and contain an abundance of cultural features. Kawela Bay Beach is located in the western region of the study area and lies between two limestone headlands. To the west of Kawela Bay is Pahipahia¯lua Beach and to the east is Wakiu Beach. The shoreline at Kawela Bay is characterized by year-round small waves attributable to the protection provided by a shallow fringing reef. The beach at the Turtle Bay Resort is known as Kalokoiki Beach. Kaihalulu Beach extends from Kalaeoka-manu Headland to Kahuku Point. The Kaihalulu shoreline is largely composed of exposed limestone shelf with a perched calcareous beach above the water line. Extending to the east of Kahuku Point and beyond the bounds of the area of study is Hanaka‘ı  ¯lio Beach. This sandy pocket of beach is bordered on both sides by outcropping carbonate grainstone (eolianite). Throughout the area of study shoreline positions are highly variable. Seasonal shifts in sand expose calcareous reef rock, beach rock, and eolianite outcrops.\\n\\nThe beaches in this study predominately face toward the N and NW. Winter months are dominated by large north Pacific swell, typically 1.5–5.0 m with 12 to 20 s periods. The annually recurring significant deep-water wave height of the north Pacific swell is 7.7 ± 0.28 m. Tradewind swell persists throughout the year, being most common during the summer; typical trade-wind swell produce wave heights of 1–3 m with 6–8 s periods.\\n\\nBurials, Hawaiian artifacts, and former home sites have been identified in the Kawela Bay Subsurface Cultural Deposit and the Kahuku Point Subsurface Cultural Deposit. Additional burials, as well as a culturally significant freshwater spring named Punaulua, have also been identified.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 28, No. 3, 2012\\n---\\n## Vulnerability of Cultural Sites to Coastal Erosion\\n\\n|KawelePaya|Kahuku Bt_|\\n|---|---|\\n|Kanuku|Kalaeokaunu|Kalaeokamanu|\\n|Oahu|Turtle Bay|Turtle Bay|\\n|9|Kawela_|Bayo|1|Resort|1608|\\n|4| | | |@al|4060200|BOD|ters|\\n|Kawela Bay| |Turtle Bay| | |Kahuku Pt|\\n| |100|120|140|160|180|200|\\n|80.00.2|1|0|1|0|1|\\n|I|8|1|8|\\n|0.5|1|1|1|1|\\n|0.6| |\\n\\nFigure 2. Kawela-Kahuku, O‘ahu. The three study areas are indicated by black boxes. Historical shoreline positions are measured at shore-perpendicular transects spaced 20 m. The ST and EX shoreline change rates correspond to the numbered transects. Shoreline change rates .0.0 (+) indicate accretion, while shoreline change rates ,0.0 (-) indicate erosion.\\n\\nOrthorectification model of the aerial images and the T-sheets from the time series of historical shoreline positions at each to the master orthorectified image and digital elevation model transect using the single-transect (ST) method and the (DEM) images. For the most part E r values are larger for T-sheets (2.57–9.4 m) than for orthophoto mosaics (0.14–2.73 m). E td arises from surveys of the horizontal movement of LWMs between spring low tides and spring high tides from three beaches on SE O‘ahu (3.14 m). E ts is based upon Shalowitz’s (1964) analysis of topographic surveys that involve mapping the high water line (HWL) as a proxy for shoreline position (5.1 m). E tc results from the conversion of the HWL shoreline to a LWM position so that historical shorelines from T-sheets can be compared to those derived from aerial photographs. E tc was found by taking the SD of the offset between the HWL and LWM positions obtained from beach topographic profile surveys at Sunset Beach (4.38 m) (Romine et al., 2009).\\n\\n### Calculating Shoreline Change Rates and Uncertainty\\n\\nIndividual Transect Rates\\n\\nDistances between historical shorelines were measured at shore-perpendicular transects spaced 20 m alongshore (Figure 1). Annual shoreline change rates were calculated\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 28, No. 3, 2012\\n---\\n536\\n\\nKane et al. direction. By incorporating data from all transects along a beach into a single model, fewer mathematical parameters are needed to calculate change rates at transects, resulting in a more parsimonious model. The EX model also assumes that shoreline data from adjacent transects are dependent upon each other, therefore accounting for the sharing of sand between transects, which ST fails to do. The uncertainty associated with both ST and EX is often high as a result of the limited number of shorelines (often ,10 shorelines) and their noisy (high positional uncertainty) behavior.\\n\\nIndividual rate uncertainties are produced by both the ST and EX models at the 95% confidence interval (CI). We use a nonparametric bootstrap method to account for additional uncertainty with the EX method, which was not addressed in Frazer, Genz, and Fletcher (2009) or Genz, Frazer, and Fletcher (2009). Bootstrapping automatically incorporates all model complexity, including the inherent error in the data-derived eigenvectors, without requiring assumptions about the population distribution. The bootstrap method resamples the data 500 times with replacement and produces a probability distribution from which an uncertainty can be calculated (Efron, 1981; Efron and Tibshirani, 1993). The resulting individual uncertainties for EX are similar in magnitude to the individual uncertainties associated with ST. The ST or EX rate is considered statistically significant if the rate is greater than the uncertainty (95% CI).\\n\\nRegional Average Rates\\n\\n|Regional Average Rates| |\\n|---|---|\\n|Waiale‘e Beach (n 5 0–19)| |\\n|Kawela Bay Beach (n 5 20–54)| |\\n|Wakiu Beach (n 5 55–80)| |\\n|Turtle Bay Beach (n 5 80–118)| |\\n|Kalokoiki Beach (n 5 119–125)| |\\n|Kaihalulu Beach (n 5 126–200)| |\\n|Hanaka‘ı ¯lio Beach (n 5 201–216)| |\\n\\nHapke et al. (2010) defined a method of calculating the uncertainty of regional average rates based upon the assumption that the rate uncertainty at each transect is partially independent of the other uncertainties. They use an effective number of independent uncertainty values (n*) calculated from a spatially lagged autocorrelation (r) of the individual rate uncertainties in the following equation from Bayley and Hammersley (1946),\\n\\nThe uncertainty of a regional average rate U R* takes into consideration n* and is estimated following Hapke et al. (2010) (Equation 2), where U R is the average of individual uncertainties,\\n\\nThe results produced by ST and EX are used to cross validate the regional average shoreline change rates. If ST and EX methods agree on both the direction of the shoreline trend (sign) and both rates are statistically significant (95% CI), then the shoreline is ‘‘very likely’’ experiencing erosion or accretion.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 28, No. 3, 2012\\n\\nErosion Hazard Zones\\n\\nCultural information is provided by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) and the SHPD of the Hawai‘i DLNR. Shapefiles (.shp) provided by OHA are used to identify and locate burials, Punaulua, and cultural deposits found within the study area. All mapping is georeferenced using the same Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection.\\n\\nWe used the most recent vegetation line (2006 or 2007) as a proxy for the landward extent of the modern beach. Erosion hazard zones are defined by extending the vegetation line 50 and 100 years at individual transect rates produced by ST and EX. The model assumes that the vegetation line and the LWM migrate at the same rate over time. Hardened surfaces may create areas where this assumption is violated and are dealt with on a case by case basis. The width of the erosion hazard zone is based upon the uncertainty of each ST and EX shoreline position. Those cultural features that fall within both the ST and EX erosion hazard zones are at significant risk of coastal erosion. Those areas that are threatened by both ST and EX within 50 years are depicted in a 50-year erosion hazard zone. A 100-year erosion hazard zone is used only for cultural features that are threatened beyond 50 years. Cultural deposits may cover large areas along the shoreline, which results in some portions of the asset being threatened by erosion, while other portions are not. ESRI ArcGIS was used to determine the area of the cultural deposit as well as the percent of the cultural deposit threatened by ST, EX, and combined ST and EX hazard zones.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nKawela Bay\\n\\nKawela Bay is fronted on the west by Pahipahia¯ lua Beach and on the east by Wakiu Beach. Three cultural features were identified in the Kawela study area: the Pahipahia¯ lua Beach Park Burial, Punaulua, and the Kawela Bay Subsurface Cultural Deposit. The Pahipahia¯ lua Beach Park Burial is a single burial that was discovered along the Pahipahia¯ lua shoreline. Located along the western point of Kawela Bay.\\n---\\n|Beach|Transect|n|ST Avg Rate (m/y)|EX Avg Rate (m/y)|Shoreline Trend|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Waiale‘e|0–19|20|20.02 ± 0.04|0.01 ± 0.04|undetermined|\\n|Kawela|20–54|34|0.04 ± 0.03|0.03 ± 0.03|likely accretional|\\n|Wakiu Beach|55–80|25|20.03 ± 0.03|20.02 ± 0.03|likely erosional|\\n|Turtle Bay Beach|81–118|37|20.08 ± 0.02|20.08 ± 0.02|very likely erosional|\\n|Kalokoiki Beach|119–125|6|20.07 ± 0.11|20.07 ± 0.06|likely erosional|\\n|Kaihalulu Beach|126–199|73|20.18 ± 0.12|20.16 ± 0.12|very likely erosional|\\n|Hanaka‘ı ¯lio Beach|200–235|35|0.01 ± 0.12|20.01 ± 0.03|undetermined|\\n\\nPunaulua is a brackish pond fed by a freshwater spring. Punaulua pond is still intact and is believed to have once been fished by Hawaiians for ulua (crevalle fish, Caranx hippos). The Kawela Bay Subsurface Cultural Deposit extends along most of Kawela Bay, as well as Wakiu, covering a total of 30,399.6 m2. O’Hare and Hammat (2006) identified midden, Hawaiian artifacts, and a total of five burials within the Cultural Deposit. Wakiu once served as an important fishing area that contained large schools of moi (sixfeeler threadfin, Polydactylus sexfilis) and a fishpond and was used as a manufacturing site for fishing gear (O’Hare and Hammat, 2006).\\n\\nThe regional average shoreline change rates were calculated separately at the 95% CI for the three beaches within Kawela using ST and EX (Table 1). At Waiale‘e the average ST and EX rates are 20.02 ± 0.04 m/y and 0.01 ± 0.04 m/y, respectively. The Waiale‘e shoreline is highly variable and contains a limited number of transects (n = 30) making it difficult to determine the direction of the shoreline change.\\n\\n|50-year Hazard Zone|Turtle Bay|\\n|---|---|\\n|Kahuku Point|Zone|\\n\\nThe Turtle Bay area includes both Kalokoiki Beach and the western portion of Kaihalulu beach. The iwi kupuna of five individuals included in Burial 4488 were found in sand that had been removed from the sand dunes inland of west Kaihalulu Beach during a sand-mining project. The average ST and EX shoreline change rates at Kalokoiki Beach are 20.07 ± 0.11 m/y and 20.07 ± 0.06 m/y, respectively (Table 1). Both ST and EX agree upon the rate of shoreline change, however, ST produced a larger rate uncertainty. The high uncertainty at Kalokoiki Beach is likely attributable to the limited number of transects (n = 6) as well as the reduced number of historical shorelines. The trend at Kalokoiki Beach is likely erosional. The ST and EX shoreline change rates at Kaihalulu Beach are 20.18 ± 0.12 m/y and 20.16 ± 0.12 m/y, respectively. Kaihalulu Beach is very likely experiencing an erosional shoreline trend. Burial 4488 may become threatened by both the ST and EX hazard zones within 100 years.\\n\\nHazard Zones\\nCultural\\nEX Hazard Zones\\n\\nFigure 3.

Globally many of the oldest settlements are located along the coast, giving coastal areas a rich cultural history. It is important to recognize the value of these areas and begin developing management options to preserve the cultural significance of these areas.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis study documents shoreline change rates and patterns and applies this information to the problem of managing cultural assets threatened by coastal erosion. Our analysis indicates that all cultural features identified, except for Punaulua (a coastal freshwater spring), are vulnerable to coastal erosion at historical rates. Managers can use the data provided in this study to rank the vulnerability of threatened cultural features and begin developing protocol to best manage and preserve the assets. The methodology provided here is not limited to Hawai‘i and may be used to identify threatened cultural features in other areas or to identify additional threatened features such as coastal infrastructure.\\n\\n## Acknowledgments\\n\\nWe thank Ayesha Genz for her assistance with the shoreline change rate scripts.

Tourism plays a significant role in the state\\'s economy, with over 60 percent of the jobs being provided by this industry. Coastal erosion is a major concern due to threats to private lands and beach resources.\\n\\n### PHYSICAL SETTING\\n\\nWhite sand beaches in Hawaii are composed of variable percentages of coralline and calcareous algae, coral, mollusk, and echinoderm fragments. The dialogue on resource management and protection is influenced by estimates of beach loss related to shoreline armoring on eroding lands.\\n---\\n## Mapping Shoreline Change Maui\\n\\nFigure Tor nuaI Chronic Erosion threatens homes on Maui Vertical aerial photograph of coastal home\\n\\nFigure 1 TopKflua~.

A combination of historical NOAA NOS topographic maps (T-sheets), hydrographic charts (H-sheets), and large-scale vertical aerial photographs were used in this study to determine historical shoreline positions and calculate long-term erosion rates (ANDERS and BYRNES, 1994). Between six and nine historical shoreline positions were defined across approximately 90 km of sandy coast and rates of shoreline movement calculated every 20 m in the alongshore direction for a total of approximately 3565 rate determinations. A methodology was designed to provide high-resolution rates of long-term shoreline change that are generally statistically significant and free of the influence of storms, tsunami, and seasonally extreme positions.\\n\\nHistorical shorelines were produced using orthorectified, high-resolution vertical aerial photographs and historical sheets and charts in a digital environment. This process is described in following sections. PCI Geomatics, Inc: (http://www.pcigeomatics.com) photogrammetric modules were used for this task and employ US Geological Survey (http://www.usgs.gov/) digital elevation models and differential global positioning system (DGPS) surveys in the orthorectification process.\\n\\nHeurual Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 38, 2003 Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 38, 2003\\n---\\n## Figure\\n\\nPortion of a 1912 1:20,000 T-sheet, West Maui coastal segment.\\n\\n## Figure 5.\\n\\nPortion of a 1912 1:20,000 T-sheet, West Maui mash1 segment.\\n\\nFor 1:20,000 T-sheets, 18.5 m for 1:10,000 T-sheets, the accuracy of a shoreline can be achieved, a vector may be shifted to better fit the rocky features that are assumed not subject to erosion.\\n\\nWe use on-screen digitizing to define a shoreline position of rocky features that are assumed not subject to erosion. Since the intent of the original survey was to map the high water mark on both sandy and rocky shorelines, it is assumed this introduces no bias to the shoreline. In most cases, the T-sheet shoreline matched rocky features, and derived shoreline for analysis, we apply two qualitative accuracy tests. First, T-sheet triangulation stations marked on the maps are tested for position accuracy against modern orthorectified photomosaics. Of 19 T-sheet shorelines used in this study, two (portions of the Makena Big Beach and Olowalu map areas) were rejected based on these tests and shifted to better fit the position of rocky features on orthophotomosaics.\\n\\nIn most cases, surveyor\\'s descriptions of triangulation stations allow their identification on modern orthophotomosaics. A misfit greater than national map accuracy standards between station coordinates as digitized from a T-sheet and station coordinates on an orthophotomosaic is grounds for rejection of the T-sheet shoreline. Secondly, we test the goodness of fit of the shoreline around rocky headlands, outcrops, and other promontories along the Maui coast by overlaying the digitized T-sheet shoreline vector on an orthophotomosaic.\\n\\nWhere appropriate and when a clear improvement is needed, the shoreline reference feature was placed on maps and charts largely to serve as an aid to navigation.\\n\\n## Shoreline Reference Feature\\n\\nEarly surveyors were trained in recognizing shoreline features representing the non-storm high tidal wash of the waves. The resulting shoreline, the high water line, was placed on maps and charts largely to serve as navigation aid.\\n\\n## Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 38, 2003\\n---\\n## Mapping Shoreline Change Maui\\n\\nMapping Shoreline Change on Maui If1 1997 988\\n\\n|Figure|Teft-North Kaanapali Beach West Maui; 1997, Right North Kaanapali Beach; West Maui; 1988.

Each study region was divided into map areas typically extending between three to seven photo frames in the alongshore direction. Within a single map area each photo is opened in Orthoen-gine and all GCPs defined. A lead photo for the new position that replicates the contemporaneous position of low water. We choose to migrate the single T-sheet shoreline rather than migrate eight low water shorelines (from air photos) because it introduces the least error of the two options. To assess the offset, we use a five-year data set of semiannual profiles (GIBBS et al., 2002; http://geopubs.\\n\\ngov/open-file/of01-308/) to develop site-specific geometric models of the offset between the high water position and the low water position. Twenty-seven beaches on Maui have been profiled during winter and summer seasons over five years. The mean offset calculated over the entire profile time series at each beach is applied as a correction to the position of the T-sheet high water line. Where shoreline movement is calculated on beaches lacking profile data, an offset is used from the nearest appropriate site experiencing similar littoral processes.\\n\\nThe PCI Imageworks module is used to construct vector of the low water position as projected in the photomosaic. Operators employ the same methodology to construct orthorectified photomosaics of historical aerial photos. Historical photos used in this study date from 1949, 1960, 1963, 1975, 1988, 1987 (used to define seasonal uncertainty; not as a shoreline), 1997, 2002. Producing historical shorelines from vertical aerial photography requires that a modern shoreline be defined. We contracted two sets of vertical aerial photos, staged to correspond with the work schedule of the analysis.\\n\\nTwo sets of photographs were flown, a 1997 survey at a scale of 1:5,200 covering the Kihei and West Maui study sites and a 2002 set flown at 1:19,500 covering the North Shore region. The 1997 photos were only available as contact prints and so a large-scale was necessary to achieve the desired ground resolution of 0.3-0.5 m. The 2002 photos were available as color diapositives that achieved the desired resolution at a smaller scale. Flight lines were shore parallel centered on the shoreline with a 60 percent overlap between adjacent frames. Ground control points (GCPs) were collected at prominent geographic and cultural features using DGPS within the area of the photos.\\n\\nBetween two and six GCPs were collected for each frame. Color film prints from the 1997 survey were scanned at 500 dpi and color diapositives from the 2002 survey at 2000 dpi.\\n\\n## Historical Shorelines\\n\\nThe PCI Imageworks module is used to construct vector of the low water position as projected in the photomosaic.

Overall, 25 Central Pacific hurricanes are known since 1950 and some 138 tropical cyclones have been identified over the period 1910-2000 (FLETCHER et al., 2002). Because storms and tsunamis usually impact shorelines on one side of an island at a time, not all beaches experience all events similarly, nor do they react similarly to every event.\\n\\nCoastal Research Special Issue No: 38, 2003 Journal of Coastal Research Special Issue No. 38, 2003\\n---\\nMapping Shoreline Change Maui\\n\\nMapping Shoreline Change on Maui 113\\n\\nFigure Orthorectification uses ground control points (GCPs, triangles) and tie points (circles) to correct modern images.\\n\\nGCP: provide elevation and position control and tie points are used to create seamless orthorectified photomosaics.\\n\\nRepresent extreme event positions.

The filter then slides to the next adjacent transect and applies the same procedure. This continues in the alongshore direction until a barrier to alongshore sediment movement is encountered such as a headland or a groin. The filter starts anew on the other side of such a barrier. The AEHR\\'s reported here have been smoothed using this technique.\\n\\nUncertainty: Several sources of uncertainty (Table 1) impact the accuracy of historical shoreline positions and the final shoreline change rates. We define two types of uncertainty: positional uncertainty and measurement uncertainty. Positional uncertainty is related to all features and phenomena that reduce the exactitude of defining the true shoreline position in a given year. These uncertainties mostly center on the nature of shoreline position at the time the aerial photo was collected. Influences on position include the stage of tide, the recent incidence of storms and the seasonal state of the beach. Each of these has been quantified as an uncertainty.\\n\\nThe uncertainty related to the tide stage is quantified through several field measurements of the shifting position of the low water mark across a spring tidal cycle. We measured this quantity at several locations and calculated a mean tidal uncertainty.\\n\\nCoastal Research; Special Issue No. 33, 2005\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 38, 2003\\n---\\n## RESULTS\\n\\nWest Maui\\n\\nWest Maui (Figure 9) extends from Ukumehame to the south along a shore arcing counterclockwise to the north and ending at Honolua Bay.

The greatest narrowing was centered on the Alaeloa 38 percent, Honokowai (36 percent), Launiupoko (34 percent), and Hekili Pt; (35 percent) map areas. Map areas with the greatest AEHR include Alaeloa (0.29 m/yr), Honokowai (0.29 m/yr), Lahaina (0.30 m/yr), Puamana (0.31 m/yr), and Ukumehame Papalua (0.31 m/yr). Endpoint rates in most cases fall within 20 percent of the AEHRs. However, at Hawea Honolua, Lahaina, and Olowalu, the EPRs differ significantly from the AEHRs. Visual inspection of individual transects in these regions indicates the LMS technique identifies the T-sheet shoreline as an outlier point and in many cases calculates an erosion rate using more recent photo-based shorelines that produce a steeper regression line than if the T-sheet were included. However, the T-sheet shoreline clearly falls away from the trend defined by more recent photo shorelines.\\n\\nTotal beach loss for the region equals approximately 4.5 km. The worst cases of beach loss are at Hawea Honolua, Lahaina, Olowalu. The coast has a generally western exposure.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 38, 2003\\n---\\nFigure 10.

They found that between 1912 and 1949, the southern part experienced erosion while the northern portion accreted. The most severe erosion occurred along the southern portion of Kalama Beach Park, averaging 1.8 m/yr. In successively later years, the focus of erosion migrated to the north end of the Halama Street area while Kawililipoa continued accreting. The shift from net accretion to erosion across the entire area started around 1975. Low rates of net sediment transport since 1975 are primarily due to sediment impoundment by coastal armoring. They identify the combined influence of coastal armoring and a series of strong Kona storms associated with an earlier phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that transported sediment to the north, opposite the present regime, as being responsible for recent erosion trends.|\\n|Maalaea|Between 1949 and 1997, the average beach width on the Kihei coast narrowed by 19 percent (Table 3). The greatest narrowing was centered at Halama Street (34 percent), North Kihei (28 percent), and North Wailea (30 percent). Map areas experienced moderate narrowing of about one third. Map areas with the greatest EPR include Kawililipoa (0.32 m/yr), Halama Street (0.46 m/yr), and North Wailea (0.32 m/yr). EPRs in four map areas differ significantly from AEHRs (Maalaea Harbor, Halama Street, Kamaole, and North Wailea). However, the remainder also show significant variation.|\\n|Makena|At South Wailea and Makena, the available T-sheet was found to be significantly distorted and so not used in calculating AEHR values. At Kawililipoa, the long period of sediment accumulation is reflected in an EPR that shows accretion (0.34 m/yr), while the AEHR reflects a more recent erosion trend (0.32 m/yr).

The sediment reservoir characterizing most Hawaiian beaches is not actively fed by offshore delivery, it dates from a former time of high production under conditions that do not exist today; and the largest and most actively accessed sediment stores lie immediately landward of beaches on the coastal plain. Given these conditions, it seems reasonable to infer that sand impoundment and sand mining (including drainage clearing) act to destabilize Maui beaches rendering them vulnerable to storm impacts governed by regional-scale climatic processes.\\n\\nTourism provides over 60 percent of jobs in Hawaii, and beaches are a major reason why visitors come to the islands. The problem of coastal erosion is a source of widespread concern because of threats to abutting private lands and loss of beach resources. A combination of NOAA T-sheets and large-scale, orthorectified vertical aerial photographs with ground resolution of 0.3-0.5 m were used to determine historical shoreline positions. This dataset is characterized by:\\n\\n1. Statistically significant long-term trends (uncertainties are typically less than trends);\\n2. Measurements representing long-term shoreline change (influence of extreme events is minimized);\\n3. High-resolution historical shoreline positions (movement of the low water position is sensitive to changes in beach volume);\\n4. High precision data sources (photographs are orthorectified and positional uncertainties are tracked); and,\\n5.

The proposed amendments would: add needed definitions; change how the shoreline setback is established by using the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area (SLR-XA) instead of the annual erosion hazard rate in most cases, while allowing changes to the new setback to be approved administratively; allow minor activities in the shoreline area without a permit; allow more activities in the shoreline area with a permit, including the repair of structures that are currently situated outside the shoreline setback but that will be situated inside the shoreline setback once the amendments take effect; and establish more detailed enforcement procedures and criteria.\\n\\nI write as Interim Dean of the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and as the Director of the Climate Resilience Collaborative (CRC), a research program at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. CRC is an affiliation of scientists, architects, attorneys, economists, planners, and undergraduate and graduate students spread across campus working on challenges related to climate change. Our work is focused on building community resiliency to climate change impacts by maximizing the effectiveness of predictive climate science and advancing our ability to dynamically respond to climate change.\\n\\nI write in support of Maui County’s proposed amendments to its Shoreline Rules because Maui’s shorelines and coastal zone are already experiencing significant detrimental impacts from sea level rise caused by climate change. Global mean sea level will rise by about 6.5 to 10 feet if warming is limited to 1.5°C, 6.5 to 20 ft if limited to 2°C and 62 to 72 ft with 5°C of warming, and it will continue to rise for centuries to millennia. There is nothing we can do to stop sea level rise. Maui’s communities need to understand the problem and Maui County must develop adaptation policies to adjust to and prepare for the new reality.\\n\\nIn my career as a scientist, I have studied, documented, and published numerous studies, papers, and textbooks that chronicle the history and gradual loss of Maui’s beaches caused by sea level rise and\\n\\nI have been a research scientist specializing in coastal processes and beach response to sea level rise for over four decades. In that time, I have published over one hundred peer-reviewed articles and three textbooks on these topics. Further, I have been a key advisor in over 30 master and PhD studies of shoreline processes in Hawaiʻi. I am also the former Chair of the Honolulu Climate Change Commission.\\n---\\nExacerbated by artificial shoreline hardening and coastal development. For instance, in 2012 I served as the lead author of National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands published by the United States Geological Survey which found that:\\n\\nMaui’s beaches are pe most erosional among [Kauaʻi, Maui, and Oʻahu]... The average long-term rate for all transects is -0.17 ± 0.01 m/yr and pe average short-term rate is -0.15 ± 0.01 m/yr. A majority of pe Maui transects indicate erosion wip 85 percent of pe long-term rates erosional and 76 percent of pe short-term rates erosional. Eleven percent (6.8 km) of pe total extent of Maui beaches studied was lost to erosion during pe analysis period—pe highest percentage of pe pree islands.\\n\\nMaui County’s proposed amendments to its Shoreline Rules incorporate an “erosion hazard line” (EHL) which uses peer-reviewed methodology and data originally conducted and published by my research lab CRC, formerly known as the Coastal Geology Group. The research was initially used for and to this day underpins the Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer hosted by the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System.\\n\\nTo be clear, I wholeheartedly support Maui County’s proposed use and application of the data in the EHL and commend Maui County and all those involved in advocating for these changes for their hard work. In short, the modeling integrated in the EHL is based on protocols that are widely used by research groups around the world in quantifying the impacts of sea level rise. This modeling has been published in the international peer-reviewed journal Nature Scientific Reports and as such it has been exposed to scrutiny by the scientific community (Anderson et al., 2018).\\n\\nThe critical data needed for this modeling include airborne LiDAR acquired by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies. We processed these data to create digital elevation models (DEMs) with high vertical and horizontal resolution. Coastal erosion modeling was conducted for sandy shorelines of Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, and Maui by CRC. The methods are described in Anderson et al. 2018 and combine historical shoreline change data with a model of beach profile response to sea level rise in order to estimate probabilities of future exposure to erosion at transects (shore-perpendicular measurement locations) spaced approximately 20 meters apart along the shoreline. The model accounts for localized alongshore variability in shoreline change by incorporating trends from the historical erosion mapping studies.\\n\\nHistorical data used to model coastal erosion consisted of:\\n\\n- See CRC’s website, available at https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/crc/index.php/publication/.\\n- National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands, United States Geological Survey, available at https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2011/1051/pdf/ofr2011-1051_report_508_rev052512.pdf.\\n- In 2017, the Hawaiʻi Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission’s adopted this data and methodology in its Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report.\\n- Anderson, T., Fletcher, C., Barbee, M., Romine, B., & Lemmo, J. 2018.

In fact, projections of local sea level rise in Hawaiʻi have increased since CRC modeled these impacts on Hawaiʻi’s shorelines, and thus these projections should be viewed as conservative. Each year, Maui’s coastal communities grow increasingly vulnerable to the dangers of wave impacts, coastal erosion, high tide flooding, and storm surge, all of which are exacerbated by sea level rise. Sea level rise is an unstoppable reality and without major adjustments to coastal laws and policies, these dangers will increase - slowly at first, as at present, but by the 2030’s sea level rise impacts related to extreme tidal flooding will increase exponentially. The 6th Assessment Report of the IPCC states with high confidence that “[i]n the longer term, sea level is committed to rise for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep-ocean warming and ice-sheet melt and will remain elevated for thousands of years.” CRC is working to update our models with more recent projections of sea level rise and to take account of other variables that impact Hawaiʻi’s shorelines.\\n\\nGiven these significant sea level rise projections, I support Maui County’s proposed amendments to its Shoreline Rules because the amendments represent a critical additional step to protect Maui’s coastal communities from the impacts of sea level rise and the amendments will have the overall effect of increasing the resilience of these communities.\\n\\nI sincerely appreciate the Maui Planning Commission’s time and effort to hear and consider the proposed amendments to the Maui County’s Shoreline Rules.

Introduction\\n\\nShoreline change models use historical shorelines to estimate the rate of change, or to predict a future shoreline, as in Figure 1a. Storm influenced shorelines raise difficult questions in this regard because shorelines tend to recover from storms. After a storm, shoreline change rate may return to its long-term trend over 5–15 years, depending on the magnitude of the storm. Should one therefore remove storm-influenced shorelines from the data when attempting to estimate the long-term trend? If so, how can one tell whether a shoreline is truly storm influenced? Here we address such questions by explicitly modeling the transient part of the storm-induced change. The storm-driven permanent change is implicitly modeled as part of the long term trend.\\n\\n### 2. One-Dimensional Models With Storms\\n\\nA storm is defined here as any event that changes the position of the shoreline suddenly, with subsequent slow recovery toward the long term trajectory. Although seasonal changes in shoreline can be rapid, recovery usually occurs within a time much shorter than the time between historical shoreline surveys, so we regard uncorrected seasonal effects as part of the noise.\\n\\nThe traditional 1D model for shoreline change is:\\n\\ny(t) = b + rt + n(t);\\n\\nwhere y is the cross-shore coordinate (shoreline location), b is the intercept, r is the long-term shoreline change rate, and n is uncorrelated noise with zero mean. The inverse problem for shoreline change is to infer the change rate from a time series of shoreline data y(t1), y(t2),..., y(tJ). The intercept depends on the baseline used to measure y, and on the time origin, both of which can be adjusted to condition the solution of the inverse problem. In mathematical parlance, the linear 1D model is a linear sum of the basis functions 1 and t. If acceleration is included in the model, there is a third basis function 1 + 2at^2, and Fenster et al. showed that models with acceleration can be more parsimonious than simple linear models. However, Crowell et al. showed that the acceleration term is good at fitting noise and that its inclusion in a model can lead to inaccurate predictions. This situation is a reminder of the importance of prior information in any inversion problem and that parsimony by itself does not select a good model unless candidate models are suitably chosen.\\n\\nSuppose that the data area is struck by a storm at time ts. We use a basis function called the storm function, given by:\\n\\ne^g(t-ts) = e^g(t-ts) if t ≥ ts\\ne^g(t-ts) = 0 if t < ts\\n\\nCitation: Frazer, L. N., T. R. Anderson, and C. H.

All models had an intercept, a long-term rate (R), and some models had one or more storms (1929, 1962, 1992). The model with lowest residuals (dotted line) had all three storms. The model with the lowest AICc value (solid line) had only the 1962 storm. The –..– model had only rate and intercept, but post-storm data were not used. (b) Profile likelihood of storm recovery rate and process noise for the shoreline model with only the 1962 storm. The likelihood is scaled to have maximum value 100, and the MLE is at h = (11.2 m)2, g 1 = 7.2 y. (c) Confidence intervals (95%) for shoreline position based on long-term rate for various models. Except for model R, the confidence intervals are conditioned on the absence of storms.

The inset shows the probabilities of the component models.\\n\\nin which g 0 is the recovery rate (the inverse time scale of with multiple storms we find that such step functions can recovery). The augmented model for shoreline change is now y(t) = b + rt + se g(t ts) + n(t) (3) in which s is the storm amplitude parameter. Since the time of the storm is known, model (3) has two more parameters than model (1). It is linear in b, r and s, but nonlinear in g. The fact that the storm function is discontinuous at t s does not make it more difficult to use, because basis functions are not required to be continuous, only independent of each other. Versions of (3) implemented with different storms or combinations of storms are regarded as different models, and we use an information criterion (below) to rate the relative goodness of models. Most historical data sets contain only 6–10 shorelines, and the information criterion usually excludes models in which each storm has its own recovery rate; therefore we use the same recovery rate parameter for all storms.\\n\\nIf some storm-induced shoreline change is permanent, an appropriate model would be (3) plus a function s pH(t ts) in which H is the unit step function and s p is the amplitude of the permanent change. In temporally sparse historical data\\n\\n## 3. Linearization\\n\\n[8] As the model is nonlinear in g, we find g by maximizing the profile likelihood [e.g., Coles, 2001, p. 34]. In order to include the effects of uncertainty in g we then linearize the model in a neighborhood of the maximum\\n---\\n|Model|Process Error (m)|\\n|---|---|\\n|Averaged model|12.5|\\n|R|30.9|\\n|R, S29|30.4|\\n|R, S62|11.2|\\n|R, S92|30.2|\\n|R, S29, S62|8.2|\\n|R, S29, S92|29.9|\\n|R, S62, S92|9.8|\\n|R, S29, S62, S92|0.1|\\n|R (no post-storm data)|9.5|\\n\\n[9] We model the noise n(t) as a zero-mean Gaussian. We assume the noise consists of observational noise (measurement noise) and process noise, and that the two noise processes are unrelated. Observational noise is estimated prior to modeling [Crowell et al., 1991; Douglas and Crowell, 2000; Fletcher et al., 2003; Genz et al., 2007]. Douglas and Crowell [2000] estimated the uncertainty in the high water line at Cotton Patch Hill as 6.5m, for a process noise variance of (6.5 m)2, but here we estimate process noise from the data. Our data covariance matrix has the form\\n\\nCy = nnT = Co + hCp; (5)\\n\\nin which Co is the covariance matrix of measurement noise, Cp is an unscaled covariance matrix of process noise, and h is a scaling parameter to be estimated from the data. We assume that observational noise at one time is uncorrelated with observational noise at other times, so Co is diagonal. Observational error ranged from 2.6 m in 1997 to 8.9 m in 1845 (Table A1 of section A in Text S1 of the auxiliary material).\\n\\n[10] Process noise should be correlated, as white noise convolved with a storm function gives a covariance matrix Cp(i, j) = (g/2)exp( gjti tjj), but our experiments suggest that g is poorly resolved by the residuals in historical data sets because the data are too sparse. In the numerical calculations presented here we take Cp to be the identity matrix (as did Douglas and Crowell [2000]). Table 1 gives\\n---\\n## 6. Information Criteria\\n\\n[14] An information criterion (IC) is a function whose value increases with the sum of squared residuals and with the number of model parameters (model complexity). The best model is the one with the lowest IC value. The use of an IC prevents over-fitting data with too many storms, but it is not a panacea, since the choice of basis functions affects the performance of the IC [McQuarrie and Tsai, 1998]. In a case where the true basis functions are included in the candidate basis functions, an IC that picks the true basis functions with probability 1 as the number of data approaches infinity is said to be consistent. In the case where at least some of the true basis functions are missing from the set of candidate basis functions, an IC that picks the combination of basis functions that best approximates the true model is said to be asymptotically efficient. The corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) used here is asymptotically efficient [McQuarrie and Tsai, 1998].\\n\\n[15] An important feature of any information criterion I is that for any positive numbers a and b, the quantity a + bI takes its minimum at the same model as I and is therefore an equally good information criterion. The AICc formula of this paper is\\n\\nAICc\\n^8 + 2K/(N - K - 1)\\nin which N is the number of data points, K is the number of model parameters, and ^8 = ^L/N - 1 log(2p), where ^L is 2 times the logarithm of the maximum likelihood. The second term in equation (10) is sometimes referred to as the complexity penalty or simply the penalty. The constant addends in the definition of ^8 make our AICc formula agree with the formula found in most books when our noise model is simplified to the usual noise model. For the noise model of this paper (equation (5)), ^8 is given by\\n\\n^m is the MLE of the parameter vector, and ^h is the MLE of the noise parameter h, hCp + Co where\\n\\n^8\\nN-1 log ^y (dG^m)T ^C-1m o 1;\\n## 7. Model Likelihood and Model Average\\n\\n[17] The number of possible models included in equation (4) is 23+Ks, but we exclude all models without rate or intercept. As several models have similar IC scores we average models based on their prior probability and IC weights [e.g., Burnham and Anderson, 2002, p. 75], referred to here as IC likelihood. We omit model selection error [Buckland et al., 1997] for consistency with methods utilizing only rate and intercept. Our method is related to Bayesian model averaging [Hoeting et al., 1999], but is thought to be less computationally intensive.\\n\\n[18] In order to define an IC likelihood, it is numerically prudent to first subtract the IC score of the best model from all the other models. Each model thus has a delta-IC given by Dj = ICj - mini(ICi). The IC likelihood of the jth model is then given by\\n\\nwj\\nPj exp(1/2 Dj) / 2 Dj\\nThe IC-likelihoods sum to 1, and are interpreted as model likelihoods conditional on the data used to compute the IC scores. We incorporate prior information about model probabilities using the probability calculus of Tarantola and Valette [1982]. Let pj be the prior probability of model j and mj be the non-informative probability of model j. The posterior probability of model j is then\\n\\npj\\nPj wj pj/mj\\nIf one has no prior information about various models, pj = mj, and so pj = wj. Here we take the non-informative probability to be uniform, so mj is the same for each j. (Even when prior probabilities are uniform, the pj are useful. For example, to compute the average of models that do not include a particular storm, set pj = 0 for each model)\\n---\\n## Table 2.

While it may be perceived by the public that the lands most at risk from sea-level rise are those immediately bordering the coastline, the threat to low-lying areas from a rising water table inland of the coast may also be great. Maui planning officials have begun to recognize that regardless of the uncertainty over projected rates of sea-level rise, threats associated with rising sea level should be identified and mitigated through a combination of modeling, mapping, and direct observation. This paper provides a review of current sea-level rise science and describes the scientific and management approaches being undertaken by Maui County to better understand potential risks associated with rising seas and account for these projections in long-range planning.\\n\\n## INTRODUCTION\\n\\nIn 2003, Maui County became the first county in the state of Hawaii to adopt a science-based approach to determining construction setbacks on coastal properties (Norcross-Nu’u and Abbott 2005). High-resolution annual erosion rate data spaced at\\n---\\n20 m intervals, produced by the University of Hawaii (UH) (Fletcher et al. 2003), are used to calculate the 50 year erosion-based setback plus a “25-foot” buffer. Following Maui’s lead, the counties of Kauai and Honolulu are acquiring erosion rate data from UH to apply towards improving understanding of shoreline changes adjacent to permitted activities. Amendments to Kauai’s setback rules have now been enacted into law requiring a 70 year erosion multiplier plus a “40 foot” buffer. The use of erosion rate data and science-based setback rules has greatly improved the management of Maui’s coastal lands (Norcross-Nu’u and Abbott 2005). Recently, however, the emerging concern of sea-level rise and the numerous associated implications of this issue have prompted Maui County to pursue further scientific and social/cultural studies to better anticipate sea-level related impacts and plan for their mitigation. As with improved setback rules resulting from erosion rate data, the intent of these studies is to provide a basis for developing new guidelines and regulations guiding coastal zone development.\\n\\nEROSION DATA\\n\\nThe University of Hawaii Shoreline Study provides shoreline change data to the public and government partners to assist in decision-making in the coastal zone. Shorelines are highly variable environments characterized by a number of natural hazards. These include: tsunami, storm surge, high winds, coastal erosion, sea-level rise, and high wave overtopping. Building on eroding coasts increases vulnerability to all these hazards. A direct step to mitigating the impact of coastal hazards is to exercise avoidance (Hwang, 2005) by mapping high hazard zones designed, in part, on data such as historical shoreline movements.\\n\\nA significant additional benefit to shoreline change data is to define zones of avoidance for the purpose of environmental conservation. When erosion threatens the built environment a common reaction is to armor the shoreline with a seawall or revetment (Fletcher et al., 1997). Armoring may impound sand thereby impacting the sediment budget of a beach and exacerbating the erosion. Shoreline armoring also increases wave turbulence and reflection. It is common to find that the construction of one seawall on a beach leads to proliferation of additional seawalls. Armoring a chronically eroding coast leads to beach loss (Fletcher, et al., 1997). In an era of accelerating sea-level rise (Church and White, 2006) the threat of chronic erosion and beach loss is growing and the use of shoreline data becomes a potentially significant coastal management tool in the effort to conserve beaches for future generations.\\n\\nA website, http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/asp/coasts/index.asp, provides the UH data in the form of sets of historical maps and orthorectified air photo mosaics, modern vertical and oblique air photos, and maps depicting rates of shoreline change spaced every 20 m on the sandy beaches of Maui, Oahu, and Kauai.\\n\\nTHE PROBLEM OF RISING SEAS\\n\\nSea-Level Rise\\n\\nChurch and White (2006) document 20th Century acceleration in the rate of global sea-level rise. Studies (i.e., Emery and Aubrey, 1991) using tide gage data over the\\n---\\n## past 100 to 120 years generally propose a global rate between 1.0 and 2.0 mm/yr\\n\\nDuring the 20th Century compared today with satellite-based estimates exceeding 3.0 mm/yr (i.e., Cazenave and Nerem, 2004) and as high as ~3.7 mm/yr over the period 1999-2004 (http://membrane.com/sidd/sealevel.html). Because significant short-term variability in sea level can occur, extracting the global mean sea level information is complex. Also, the satellite data has a much shorter record than tidal gages, which have been found to require years of operation to extract trends.\\n\\n## Global sea-level rise is assumed to be caused by two principal sources:\\n\\nMelting of the ice reservoirs on Greenland and Antarctica, as well as various alpine glaciers and ice sheets; and, thermal expansion of the upper ocean water column due to heating of the atmosphere.\\n\\n## Glaciers in southern Greenland\\n\\nAre flowing 30 to 210 percent faster than they were ten years ago and the overall amount of ice discharged into the sea increased from 90 km3 in 1996 to 224 km3 in 2005, up 250 percent (BBC News, 2006). Greenland\\'s contribution to average sea rise increased from 0.23 mm/year in 1996 to 0.57 mm/year in 2005, and melting accounts for between 20 and 38 percent of the observed yearly global sea level rise (Hansen et al., 2007). Notably, two-thirds of Greenland\\'s contribution (0.38 mm/yr) is due to glacier dynamics (chunks of ice breaking off and melting), and one-third (0.19 mm/yr) is from direct melting of ice.\\n\\nAs glacier acceleration and melting continue to spread northward, Greenland\\'s contribution to global sea-level rise will continue to increase in coming years. In 2007 the number of melting days on Greenland set a new record (AGU, 2007).\\n\\n## Antarctica\\n\\nPotentially the largest trigger of global sea-level rise, presents a more enigmatic picture than Greenland. On average the globe has warmed about 1.1°F in the 50 years ending in 2005, while Antarctica has cooled about 10°C in October-November since 1985. Why has the air above Antarctica cooled over this period? The Antarctic ozone hole opened up about the same time as cooling began. Ozone absorbs UV radiation heating the atmosphere around it and absence of ozone has led to cooling in the stratosphere. Importantly, Antarctica is dominated by a strong band of westerly winds that tend to isolate the continent, keeping global warming from influencing Antarctic weather, and allowing the surface to cool.\\n\\nHowever, the Antarctic Peninsula lies at the outer reach of the vortex allowing the peninsula to warm significantly over the same time period (http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/walse/). Notably, the circumpolar vortex has strengthened in the past 25-30 years, forming an even stronger barrier than usual. However, climate modelers predict the circumpolar vortex will weaken as the ozone hole diminishes in coming decades. This will allow the Antarctic to warm with the rest of the globe, a process that has already begun. In their latest study (September 20, 2007) NASA researchers have confirmed that Antarctic snow is melting farther inland from the coast over time, melting at higher altitudes than ever and increasingly melting on Antarctica\\'s largest ice shelf, the Ross Ice Shelf.\\n\\nOn the Antarctic Peninsula, the rate of atmospheric warming has reached 5 times the global average. Since 1945, the Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a warming of about 2.5°C and the annual melt season has increased by 2 to 3 weeks in just the past 3 years.\\n---\\n## 20 years\\n\\nCook et al. (2005) document that 87 percent of glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula are now retreating in a pattern that is spreading to the south annually. In the coastal region the 1,994 km2 Larsen A ice shelf disintegrated suddenly in January 1995, and after 400 years of relative stability, nearly 2,978 km2 of the Larson B and Wilkins ice shelves collapsed between March 1998 and March 1999. Additionally, the Southern Ocean surrounding the Antarctic continent has experienced a strong warming trend. Measurements from data recorders in waters around Antarctica show a (0.17° C) rise in ocean temperatures between the 1950’s and the 1980’s.\\n\\nThermal warming of the ocean surface is thought to account for about half of the current trend of global sea-level rise, while ice melt accounts for about 35 percent. The missing components are an indication of the high degree of uncertainty in the science of sea-level prediction. One way to circumvent this uncertainty is to model sea-level change on the basis of its relationship to atmospheric warming using historical records. Rahmstorf (2007) compared the record of global surface warming over the past 120 years and related it to the record of sea-level change over the same period. He found that the relationship predicted a global sea-level rise of 0.5 to 1.4 m by the end of this century under climate change scenarios projected by the IPCC (2007). In another paper, Rahmstorf et al. (2007) compared projections of climate change made in 1990 by the IPCC and found that observations in 2005 matched the upper limit of their projections.\\n\\nA recent study in Nature (Rohling, et al., 2008) finds that average rates of sea-level rise of 1.6 m per century occurred during the last interglacial period. They conclude that because global temperatures during the last interglacial were comparable to modern projections of climate change this century under the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions, these rates of sea-level rise are relevant to the ongoing debate about high versus low rates of rise this century.\\n\\n## Coastal Erosion\\n\\nAs sea-level rises, shorelines experiencing a deficiency in sediment, or those at equilibrium with sediment availability, are likely to experience erosion (Bruun, 1983). As with most coastal communities nationwide, erosion has taken its toll on Maui’s shores with over 8 km of beach lost since 1949 and 4.8 km of roadways threatened within the next 20 years (Fletcher et al. 2003). With an average rate of retreat of 0.3 m/yr for Maui’s sandy shorelines and a recorded rise in local sea level averaging 2-2.5 mm/yr over the last half-century, the relationship between sea-level rise and sandy shoreline retreat has been, on average, 1:150 to 1:120. With global sea-level rise observed to have almost doubled over the last decade (Church and White 2006), the likelihood exists that erosion rates will also accelerate. For this reason, Maui County has committed to updating the erosion rate data at intervals of no longer than every 10 years. Given the inevitability of a time lag for data sets to reflect increased rates of erosion, Maui’s 50-year construction setback may significantly underestimate the true 50-year safety margin under current and future erosional trends.\\n---\\nImprovements in the ability to model shoreline changes using the entire dataset for a littoral cell, and not only the data along a single transect, promise that the next update of Maui erosion trends will be characterized by reduced uncertainty, increased statistical significance, and improved ability to predict future shoreline positions (Genz et al., 2007; Frazer et al., in press, Genz et al., in press). It is vital to continually refine and improve models that provide statistically significant erosion hazard predictions. To further the goal of providing reliable erosion study results, UH researchers have developed the PX and PXT methods for calculating shoreline erosion rates. Recognition of a number of problems with the single transect (ST) method spurred this research. ST uses historical shoreline positions along a shore normal transect to calculate rates of shoreline change. Each transect calculates change independent of neighboring transects. This is unparsimonious. That is, it tends to over-fit the data by using more mathematical parameters than necessary to model the change at a beach because it assumes adjacent transects are independent. In theory, adjacent transects should tell a similar story about the change occurring at a beach because beach positions share sand along the shore. Instead, ST treats the beach as if it were a set of 20 m wide blocks that move independent of each other. ST also produces many rates that are not statistically significant, i.e., the rates are statistically indistinguishable from a rate of 0.0 m/yr. Importantly, short-term fluctuations in the beach due to seasonal and tidal changes (high complexity) and a lack of historical shoreline data (poor sampling) can mask long-term trends when attempting to calculate a change rate from a single transect.\\n\\nTo address these problems, UH has developed the PX methods (Polynomial in distance X) for calculating shoreline change rates to produce more meaningful, i.e., statistically significant and defensible, shoreline change rates. PX combines data from all transects along a beach and models shoreline change for the entire length of beach using polynomial regression. The resulting shoreline change models produce rates that vary continuously in the alongshore direction. These models employ information from the entire beach to model the rate at any one location. An advancement of the PX method, called PXT (Polynomial in distance X and Time) models shoreline change rates along the shore and with time. For sufficient data, PXT can find acceleration in the shoreline change rate – an important advance, as most beaches do not erode or accrete at a constant (linear) rate. See Romine et al., this volume, for applications of this methodology.\\n\\nInland Flooding\\n\\nAt least one community in Hawaii, Mapunapuna, located 2 km inland from the nearest shoreline, already experiences a debilitating inundation under extreme high tide conditions. During heavy rainfall events or high spring-tides, storm drains tied directly to the ocean back up with seawater, flooding streets with a mixture of ocean water and run-off forming a unique version of an urban estuary. Having entered through the seaward mouth of storm drain pipes, marine species of fish, and even hammerhead shark pups are observed in these 1 m deep pools in the midst of the industrial region. In low-lying coastal areas on Maui, salt rinds and splash marks are seen surrounding urban storm drains over 200 m inland from the coast when high tides coincide with high surf events. As these harbingers indicate, inundation is likely\\n---\\nto occur in low-lying coastal communities with increasing frequency as sea level continues to rise. The critical issue here is the hazard of marine flooding located in low-lying areas some distance from the shoreline.\\n\\nRising Water Table Within coming decades, an increase in the elevation of the water table, associated with rising sea levels, will threaten low-lying lands on Hawaii coastal plains in several ways. Even before rising groundwater breaks the surface, aquifer contamination will occur, and subsurface drainage infrastructure such as leach fields, perforated pipes and retention basins will lose functionality as they are submerged by groundwater. While coastal groundwater is not used for human consumption, a significant portion of Maui’s treated wastewater is disposed of via injection wells, and the potential impacts of a rising water table on the injection wells have not been considered, nor has the possibility of contaminated plumes making their way to the surface with the rising water table as it breaches the ground surface.\\n\\nThese impacts will not be limited to areas immediately adjacent to the ocean. Through the evaluation of methods to estimate hydraulic properties within the coastal plain on Maui, Rotzoll (2007) found that groundwater fluctuations as far as 5 km inland are tied to fluctuations in sea level. Water table levels were found to correlate with tide gauge data as well as with wave setup data from high surf events. For both tides and setup, propagation of the signal through the aquifer showed exponentially decreasing amplitudes and linearly increasing time lags. This research demonstrates that sea-level processes are directly connected to the position of the water table – there will be no time lag between sea-level rise and water-table rise.\\n\\nMANAGEMENT APPROACHES Currently, coastal erosion and management issues arise and are dealt with on a case-by-case, property-by-property basis. The outcome of this approach can be seen on most of Maui’s sandy shorelines as a highly inconsistent patchwork of various erosion mitigation methods. There is a high degree of frustration among community members as they watch their favorite beaches disappear piece by piece, and as access to beaches becomes increasingly limited. Hazards such as sea-level rise and storm damage vulnerability are not included in the development review process and lead to increased vulnerability for coastal resources as well as coastal structures and their inhabitants.\\n\\nSea-level Rise Inundation Models Much of Maui’s critical infrastructure is located immediately adjacent to the coast, including the Central Maui Wastewater Treatment Facility, numerous state and county highways, and one of Maui’s two electricity generation facilities (Figure 1). In 2004, analyses of options to provide needed improvements to the wastewater facility evaluated tsunami inundation potential, but did not consider the threat of rising sea levels. Because of recent advances in understanding potential threats related to sea-level rise, Maui County is starting to recognize the importance of identifying areas at risk of inundation for long range planning purposes. In early 2008, the Maui County General Plan is undergoing update, and advisory committees\\n---\\nwill be discussing designated sites for relocation of public infrastructure currently located in high-risk areas.\\n\\n|Kahului Power Plant|\\n|---|\\n|Kahului Wastewater Reclamation Facility|Proposed Scrap Metal Facility Site|\\n\\nFig. 1. Existing and proposed infrastructure threatened with rising sea level in Kahului, Maui\\n\\nUH researchers have begun producing high resolution, lidar-based sea-level rise inundation maps for densely populated areas such as Waikiki and Honolulu. Despite the fact that impacts may not yet be seen for decades, the dramatic nature of the images depicting 1 m sea-level rise under high tide and heavy rainfall have prompted Maui officials to request inundation modeling for this island as well. Digital elevation models based on Lidar data have elevation accuracy in the range 0.25 – 0. 5 m, hence inundation maps serve as precise planning tools through the identification of specific areas where planning for inundation is prudent.\\n\\nAs an example, in a recent development application, sea-level rise was taken into consideration for the first time on Maui. The proposed project is a scrap metal and auto recycling facility to be located three blocks inland in the Kahului industrial area, and adjacent to a federally protected wetland (Figure 1). The drainage infrastructure, including underground retention basins, perforated drainage pipes and a leach field, was designed with multiple redundancies to significantly reduce the risk of spills and contamination to the wetland.\\n\\nUpon closer analysis, it could be seen that the drainage infrastructure was designed to be located immediately above the existing water table. Additionally, preliminary inundation maps indicated this to be a high-risk area due to its low elevation and proximity to the wetland. As a result, the possibility of failure of the drainage\\n---\\ninfrastructure within the next several decades was high, particularly in light of the previously mentioned relationship between ground water levels and sea surface levels (Rotzoll 2007). Despite the fact that specific policy or regulations regarding sea-level rise do not yet exist, the developers agreed to raise the overall grade of the property by up to 0.6 m to accommodate the potential for rising ground water levels.\\n\\nStorm Wave Inundation Models Recent unpublished studies by UH model the relationship between inland incursions of storm waves and rising sea-levels. Preliminary results for the island of Oahu show significant increases in the area of land vulnerable to storm damage with a sea-level rise of less than 1m. As with the sea-level rise inundation models, storm wave inundation maps are critical for long-range planning purposes, and will be created for Maui as part of the project described in the following subsection.\\n\\nShoreline Prioritization and Management Model The Maui County Department of Planning is working under a collaborative grant with UH and the Maui Coastal Land Trust to develop a prioritization model for coastal resource management on Maui. The goal of this project is to combine scientific data with social/cultural input to identify acceptable approaches to shoreline management for individual shoreline segments, or littoral cells.\\n\\nThe scientific component will include data layers illustrating hazard levels for flooding, coastal erosion, sea-level rise, and storm damage. The social/cultural component will include community input regarding the relative value of individual shoreline areas for cultural, recreational, and economic pursuits. The overlay of all these factors will be used to establish priority areas for protection of the coastal lands, and priority areas for preservation of sandy beach resources.\\n\\nAlong with the priority outcomes, an analysis of allowable shore protection strategies will be produced for each shoreline segment. For regions where protection of coastal lands is a priority, such as areas with a high density of resort development, hard structures such as seawalls or revetments may be allowed. For areas where the priority for protection of beaches and coastal lands is roughly equal, such as areas with moderate development levels and healthy beaches, conditions may be established allowing soft forms of shore protection such as beach replenishment, possibly in conjunction with groins. For areas where protection of beach resources is a priority, such as pristine beach areas with limited or no existing development, conditions may be established prohibiting the use of any form of shore protection.\\n\\nThe model will be used to provide guidance to planners and decision-makers, and for potential adoption of improved coastal management regulations. The anticipated outcome is to be able to better manage coastal resources through a comprehensive littoral cell-based approach rather than an ad-hoc, property-by-property approach.\\n\\nBeach Management Plan The Beach Management Plan for Maui (Mullane and Suzuki 1997) is a document intended to provide basic coastal processes educational information and\\n---\\nrecommendations for steps towards improving the management of Maui’s coastal resources. A 2007 update of the plan (Norcross-Nu’u, Fletcher and Abbott in review) makes specific recommendations for identifying infrastructure, communities and developments at risk of sea-level rise and for the development of long-term plans to address the associated issues of a rising water table. Emphasis in the Beach Management Plan is also placed on the development of littoral-cell based coastal zone management as a more effective means of addressing coastal hazards and resource protection. While the first edition of the plan was adopted by the Maui County Council as a guiding policy document, the newly-revised second edition will go through the more rigorous process of adoption as an ordinance, so that it may be enforceable as a law.\\n\\nCONCLUSION Global sea-level rise is an ongoing and accelerating process with high likelihood of becoming a serious threat to coastal environments and development in coming decades. Recognizing that sea-level rise will cause significant changes to Maui’s landscape in coming decades was a promising first step for Maui County governing officials. Assembling the framework for achieving an understanding of what these impacts may be has been an encouraging second step. The development of long-range plans incorporating community input, designs for high-hazard areas and resource protection objectives, is a challenging but achievable goal. Maui County hopes to be a leader both statewide and nationwide in addressing these emerging and critical issues.\\n\\n## REFERENCES\\n\\nAmerican Geophysical Union (2007) Abstracts wip proceedings, Annual Meeting, SFO, Dec., 2007.\\nBBC News, 11 August, 2006: \"Greenland melt \\'speeding up\\' \"\\nBruun, P.

Through this report the Legislature aimed to address the threat posed by climate change to the economic well-being, public health, natural resources, and environment of Hawai\\'i. The 2017 Report was prepared in recognition that sea level rise (SLR) is an inevitable outcome of global warming that will continue far into the future, even with an immediate and drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to the preparation of the 2017 Report, Act 32 charged the Hawai\\'i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of implementation and submit a report to the governor, legislature, and the counties no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of the 2023 Legislature and every five years thereafter. This document serves as the five-year update to the 2017 Report and the Commission’s report on recent sea level rise adaptation initiatives across State and County government, many of which are a direct result of the information and map data provided by the 2017 Report and companion State of Hawai\\'i Sea Level Rise Viewer (Viewer).\\n\\nScientific Observations and Predictions\\n\\nIn 2017, and again in 2020, the Honolulu Harbor Tide gauge recorded its highest daily mean water levels observed over its 112-year history. These record high water levels were produced by a combination of phenomena that included long-term global sea level rise, peak annual astronomical tides (“king tides”), wave setup, and migration of warm buoyant waters brought in by winds and currents. These events provide a glimpse of what will become a more regular occurrence as sea level continues to rise. Local impacts were observed throughout the State in the form of increased coastal erosion, minor wave over-wash flooding, backshore flooding from groundwater rise and storm drain backflow, and impeded and potentially hazardous beach access.\\n\\nThe United Nations Environment Program Emissions Gap Report, 2022 indicates that globally, nations have missed the emissions goals that may have constrained overall global warming to 1.5°C, and that given our current path and past actions, the world is likely to warm by 2.8°C by the end of the century. Sea level responds to greenhouse gas emissions more slowly than global surface temperature. This slow response leads to long-term committed SLR, associated with ongoing ocean heat uptake and the slow adjustment of the ice sheets. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report states with high confidence that “Global mean sea level will continue to rise for thousands of years, even if future CO2 emissions are reduced to net zero and global warming halted, as excess energy due to past emissions continues to propagate into the deep ocean and as glaciers and ice sheets continue to melt.” (Arias, et al. (2021)).\\n\\nSea level rise exposure mapping in the 2017 Hawai‘i Sea Level Rise Report and Hawaii Sea Level Rise Viewer is based on an upper-end projection in the 2013 IPCC 5th Assessment Report of 3.2 feet of global mean sea level rise by 2100. Since completion of the 2017 Report, peer-reviewed scientific literature as\\n---\\nWell as government and multinational reports increasingly point to 3 to 4 feet of sea level rise by 2100 as a mid-range, rather than high-end, scenario for Hawai‘i. Long-term observational data from local tide gauge stations show that sea level is rising around Hawai‘i. Models indicate that Hawai‘i and other tropical Pacific sites will experience sea level rise that is 16% to 20% higher than the global average (Sweet. et al. 2022). As the science progresses towards increasingly concerning rates of sea level rise for Hawai`i, it remains imperative that the legislature and state and county agencies maintain a long-term focus on building resiliency to rising seas by reducing overall vulnerability of infrastructure and implementing adaptation measures to allow our state to continue to thrive with higher seas.\\n\\nAccomplishments and Progress\\n\\nThe 2017 Report included nine recommendations with 49 recommended actions aimed at improving the state’s capacity to address the social, economic, and environmental impacts of sea level rise.\\n\\nKey Statewide Accomplishments:\\n\\n- Use of the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area Data and Sea Level Rise Viewer: Although the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area (SLR-XA) was not officially recognized as a state-wide vulnerability zone, the Viewer and SLR-XA are in widespread use by state and county agencies for adaptation planning purposes.\\n- Hawai`i Coastal Zone Management Act Updates: Act 16, SLH2020 updated the Hawai`i Coastal Zone Management Act (HRS Chapter 205A) including strengthening protections for beach and other coastal environments by specifically prohibiting private shoreline hardening structures and minimizing public shoreline hardening structures, including seawalls and revetments, at sandy beaches where they would interfere with existing recreational and waterline activities.\\n- Sea Level Rise Report Addendum: The Guidance for Using the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area in Local Planning and Permitting Decisions was published by the State as a supplement to the 2017 Report. The Addendum was prepared by the University of Hawai`i Sea Grant College Program (Hawai`i Sea Grant) with the Hawai`i Department of Land and Natural Resources - Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands (OCCL) for the Hawai`i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission - Climate Ready Hawai`i Initiative. The Hawai`i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission issued a statement of approval for the Addendum at its October 28, 2020 meeting.\\n- Hawai`i 2018 Hazard Mitigation Plan: The 2018 update of the State’s Hazard Mitigation Plan includes expanded consideration of climate change and sea level rise hazards, including hazard assessment using the SLR-XA and a 1% Annual-Chance Coastal Flood Zone with 3.2 feet of sea level rise (1%CFZ-3.2) modeled for the Plan: https://dod.hawaii.gov/hiema/sert-resources/hazard-mitigation/\\n- Planning for Managed Retreat: The Office of Planning and Sustainable Development Coastal Zone Management Program (OPSD-CZM) published a report titled Assessing the Feasibility and Implications of Managed Retreat Strategies for Vulnerable Coastal Areas in Hawai`i in 2019 and is embarking on a next-step study that will assess the options for and implications of implementing managed retreat from the perspectives of (1) policy and regulation, and (2) funding and financing mechanisms in 2023.\\n- Statewide Inventory of Vulnerable Infrastructure: Act 178 Relating to Sea Level Rise Adaptation was passed to begin the long-term planning needed to effectively address climate impacts. OPSD-CZM submitted a report to the legislature in 2021 reporting on progress towards the phased approach required by Act 178.\\n---\\nSummary of Accomplishments\\n\\n|Progress towards meeting the nine recommendations (represented by large circles) and 49 associated recommended actions (represented by small circles underneath) is presented here as measured on a qualitative scale of “no known progress” to “significant progress” as depicted by the following key:|\\n|---|\\n|No Known Progress|Starting Progress|Some Progress|Significant Progress|\\n\\n|01|support sustainable and resilient land use and community development:|\\n|---|---|\\n|03|Prioritize smart urban redevelopment outside SLR-XA and limit exposure within the SLR-XA:|\\n|04|Incentivize improved flood risk management;|\\n|05|Enable legacy beaches to persist with sea level rise Preserve Native Hawaiian culture and communities with sea level rise:|\\n|06|Protect nearshore water quality from sea level rise impacts|\\n|07|Incentivize improved flood risk management;|\\n|08|Enable legacy beaches to persist with sea level rise.

This Report Update recommends continuing work on the nine 2017 Recommendations and associated recommended actions, and adds two new 2022 Recommendations with supporting recommended actions.\\n\\n2022 Recommendation 1 is to fund and conduct a comprehensive update of the Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report in 2027, and 2022 Recommendation 2 is to continue to implement the 2017 Recommendations with minor edits as outlined in this 2022 Report Update. The recommended actions within these two new recommendations provide a framework for further identifying gaps in progress since 2017 and meeting the overall goals of this initiative. A key updated recommended action is for the state to set a revised planning and policy benchmark of 4 ft (up from the 2017 guidance of 3.2ft) as the minimum scenario for all planning and design based on the report’s Intermediate (mid-range) scenario for Hawai`i of 3.9 feet of sea level rise by 2100, and apply a 6 ft benchmark for planning and design of public infrastructure projects and other projects with low tolerance for risk based on the report’s Intermediate High scenario for Hawai`i of 5.9 feet of sea level rise by 2100.\\n\\nIn addition to the recommendations, this report has identified the following unmet needs and areas in need of focus in the next five years which should be set as priority action areas from 2023-2027.\\n\\n- Facilitate interagency coordination for holistic adaptation planning (e.g., comprehensive consideration and planning for natural resources, roads, communities; and improved communications between government agencies) (2017 Recommendation 9, 2022 Recommendation 1)\\n- Conserve and adapt Native Hawaiian cultural resources and sites (2017 Recommendation 5)\\n- Integrate equity and justice considerations to vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning and actions (2017 Recommendation 2)\\n- Address and stop the loss of shoreline access (2017 Recommendation 4)\\n- Integrate economic valuation and ecosystem co benefits of natural coastal resources into planning and actions (2017 Recommendations 4, 5 and 8)\\n- Make managed retreat a viable option and identify funding mechanisms for adaptation (2017 Recommendations 2 and 7)\\n- Implement phased adaptation to sea level rise (2017 Recommendation 1, 2, 7)\\n\\nOur understanding of the sea level rise outlook has improved since the 2017 Report and we now have a better understanding of the most probable impacts of sea level rise in Hawai`i. This Updated Report and the recommendations within should be used as a tool by the decision makers of the State, the Counties, and community leaders. Recommendations to increase our capacity to adapt to sea level rise should be implemented across the levels of government now to address the inevitable near and medium-term rise of sea level rise.\\n---\\n## Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report 2022 Update\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe 2017 Report provided the first detailed statewide assessment of Hawaii’s exposure to sea level rise related hazards and proposed recommendations to reduce the state’s vulnerability to sea level rise and increase our capacity to adapt. This report is intended as a five-year update to the 2017 Report and is not a full review or stand-alone document. Instead, it refers to the 2017 Report and provides an overview of updates to climate and sea level rise science, the accomplishments achieved relative to the 2017 Report recommendations, and provides updated recommendations for the next five years and beyond. “Learning Questions” posed by the 2017 Report are directly addressed in Appendix (A) of this Report.\\n\\nSea Level Rise Outlook: Updated Global and Local Projections\\n\\nThe 2017 Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report provided a detailed overview of climate science and sea level rise observations and predictions based on the latest and best-available science at that time including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) and the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) 4th National Climate Assessment. As expected, climate and sea level rise science has continued to advance since the 2017 Report, with landmark intergovernmental reports including the IPCC AR6 in August 2020 and NOAA-led Sea Level Rise Technical Reports in 2017 and 2022. An update on Sea Level Rise Science was provided as an appendix in an October 2020 Hawai`i Climate Change Commission document, Guidance for Using the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area in Local Planning and Permitting Decisions - A Supplement to the Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report. In July 2022, the City and County of Honolulu Climate Change Commission provided an updated guidance document on the latest sea level rise science and projections with recommendations for adaptation planning. This section provides an overview of the latest climate science and sea level rise projections published in those documents with specific regional and local projections and likely impacts.\\n\\nGlobal and Local Sea Level Rise Trends\\n\\nSea level rise exposure mapping in the 2017 Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Report and Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Viewer (Viewer) is based on an upper-end projection in the 2013 IPCC 5th Assessment Report of 3.2 feet of global mean sea level rise by 2100. As expected, the science on sea level rise observations and forecasts has continued to advance. Since completion of the 2017 Report, peer-reviewed scientific literature as well as government and multinational reports increasingly point to 3 to 4 feet of sea level rise by 2100 as a mid-range, rather than high-end, scenario for Hawai`i. These increasing projections of sea level rise are based on greenhouse gas emissions, which continue to increase, and observations of accelerating ice mass loss to the oceans, particularly from Greenland and West Antarctica. The projections are often provided to 2100, though sea level rise will likely continue for centuries.\\n---\\nSince 1993, 27 years of continuous satellite altimeter measurements tied to tide gauges and averaged across the planet (Figure 1) show that global mean sea level is not only rising at a rate of 3.4 mm/yr (1.3 inches per decade, sealevel.nasa.gov), it is accelerating at a rate that will lead to 23 cm (9 inches) of global mean sea level rise by 2050 (relative to the year 2000; Nerem et al., 2022). Continued global warming is expected to increase this rate of acceleration, and therefore 9 inches of sea level rise by 2050 is likely a conservative (low-end) sea level rise scenario for that timeframe.\\n\\n|Figure 1. Global mean sea level is rising at a rate of 3.4 mm/yr (1.3 inches per decade, sealevel.nasa.gov) and this rate is accelerating (Figure: Nerem et al., 2022).|\\n|---|\\n| |1995|2000|2005|2010|2015 2020|\\n| |Quadratic fit|Observed GMSL|\\n|1|82|~20|\\n\\nThe most recent projections of global and regional sea level rise are published in a 2022 intergovernmental report led by NOAA (Sweet et al. 2022). The 2022 report builds on a 2017 NOAA report (Sweet et al., 2017) and global mean sea level rise scenarios from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6; IPCC 2021). Key findings of the NOAA 2022 report include:\\n\\n- Increased confidence, regardless of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions scenario, in sea level rise projections at 2050 with sea level expected to rise as much over the next 30 years as it has over the last 100 years.\\n- An increase in magnitude and frequency of coastal flooding by 2050 from high tide and storm surge flood events with significant consequences to coastal infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems.\\n- A 50% probability of exceeding 0.5 m (1.6 ft) of sea level rise globally by 2100 with an increase in average global temperature of 2°C above preindustrial levels (global temperature has already risen 1.01°C since 1880). The probability of exceeding 0.5 m (1.6 ft) of global sea level rise increases to 80% to 99% under higher GHG emissions scenarios with 3°-5°C of warming, respectively. These probabilities do not consider the potential for faster-than-projected ice\\n---\\nsheet losses in Antarctica and Greenland within this century, which is a focus of ongoing research.\\n\\n- There is a 50% probability of exceeding 1.0 m (3.3 ft) and 10% probability of exceeding 2.0 m (6.6 ft) of global sea level rise by 2100 when considering a high GHG emissions scenario that leads to an average global temperature increase of 5°C plus the impact of earlier and faster ice sheet losses from Antarctica and Greenland. While physically plausible, the likelihood of widespread ice sheet collapse to that extent within this century is currently unknown and is an active area of ongoing observation and research.\\n\\nLong-term observational data from local tide gauge stations show that sea level is rising around Hawai`i. Models indicate that Hawai`i and other tropical Pacific sites will experience sea level rise that is 16% to 20% higher than the global average (Sweet. et al. 2022). The NOAA 2022 report provides a range of regionalized sea level rise scenarios based on differing GHG emissions pathways and associated global warming and ice sheet melt (all projections relative to sea level in the year 2000):\\n\\n- Sea level will rise around Hawai`i between 0.7 and 1.5 feet by 2050.\\n- The Intermediate (mid-range) estimate is for a rise of 1.0 feet by 2050.\\n- Sea level will rise between 1.3 and 8.0 feet by 2100.\\n- The Intermediate (mid-range) estimate is for a rise of 3.9 feet by 2100.\\n\\nLow confidence processes including rapid ice sheet melt and marine ice sheet disintegration, combined with very high emissions and global warming, contribute significantly to the Intermediate, Intermediate High, and High sea level rise scenarios. Emissions uncertainty, or the amount of future emissions and associated global warming, drive long-term differences between the Low, Intermediate-Low, and Intermediate sea level rise scenarios. Process uncertainty, how well sea level rise processes are understood and can be modeled, represented the shading above and below the median.\\n\\nObservational data show that sea levels are rising:\\n\\n|1970|2000|2020|2050|2100|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Tide Gauge Observations| | |Low|Intermediate High|\\n|Observation Extrapolation| | |Intermediate-Low|High|\\n\\nFigure 2.

Sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100 for Hawai`i from interagency report (Sweet, et al. 2022).\\n\\nIn a study by researchers at the University of Hawai`i Sea Level Center and others, it was reported that rapid increases in tidal flooding are expected to begin locally by the mid-2030’s (Thompson, et al. 2021). This increase will be the result of ongoing sea level rise in combination with natural cyclicity in tidal amplitudes, i.e., natural variations in the highest high tides. By the early 2040’s Honolulu is projected to experience 2 to 3 high tide flood days per month considering NOAA’s intermediate SLR scenario. However, such high tide events will be clustered over times of the year when tides are at their peak (i.e., during “king tides”), in which as many as 6-14 days per month can be expected. Thus, researchers recommend that compound flood impacts during these more extreme periods of tidal flooding be considered in flood management planning instead of annual averages (Thompson, et al. 2021).\\n\\nCompound flooding describes flood sources that are additive to that generated by sea level rise alone. Compound flood sources can include the shallowing or emergence of coastal groundwater, rain events, and overwhelming of drainage systems that can ironically act as additional sources of floodwater. In a study that investigated proportions of flooding in Honolulu’s Primary Urban Core caused by single, versus multiple components of sea level rise induced inundation, it was found that less than three percent was caused solely by direct overland connection to a rising ocean. Sources of compound flooding and exacerbation of such flooding by rising sea level should be a top consideration as part of ongoing research and flood management planning.\\n---\\n## Local Observations of Coastal Impacts\\n\\nThe 2017 Report provided a detailed outline of the statewide results of the vulnerability assessment based on the outputs of the SLR-XA model and Viewer. Vulnerability was assessed in terms of potential impacts to land use, people, property, cultural and natural resources, and critical infrastructure. This section provides an overview of the observed local impacts since 2017 to inform the application of the SLR-XA to current and future planning efforts. This report does not include an updated assessment of the potential economic loss or impacts on people, roads, other infrastructure and ecological features within the SLR-XA. Such analyses will be included as part of planned updates to the Report and Viewer.\\n\\nAs was identified in the 2017 Report, chronic coastal flooding within the SLR-XA is an ongoing problem. The consequences of elevated sea level have already become apparent. In 2017, and again in 2020, the Honolulu Harbor Tide gauge recorded its highest daily mean water levels observed over its 112-year history. These record high water levels were produced by a combination of phenomena that included long-term global sea level rise, peak annual astronomical tides (“king tides”), wave setup, and migration of warm buoyant waters brought in by winds and currents. These events provide a glimpse of what will become a more regular occurrence as sea level continues to rise. Local impacts were observed throughout the State in the form of increased coastal erosion, minor wave over-wash flooding, backshore flooding from groundwater rise and storm drain backflow, and impeded and potentially hazardous beach access.\\n\\nIn addition to the observed coastal flooding, elevated water levels and recent extreme rainfall events have spurred concern regarding the functionality of municipal drainage systems, especially across heavily developed low-lying areas. Drainage systems in these areas were designed to convey stormwater from higher elevation to lower elevation waterways. As sea level rises, differences in these elevations have become reduced, and at times reversed, such that drainage systems are becoming increasingly inundated even in the absence of rainfall. Additionally, it is typical for these systems to feature cracks that can allow surrounding elevated groundwater to enter, further reducing drainage capacity. Reverse flow of stormwater is commonly observed in locations like Mapunapuna and Waikiki on O`ahu. Present drainage issues illustrate the fact that coastal flooding will increasingly be generated by a variety of flood sources including the contribution from stormwater conduits, particularly during heavy rainfall events.\\n\\nThe progressive impacts of sea level are likewise evident in the form of chronic coastal erosion. As expected, such erosion has continued along the majority of the State’s coastlines, resulting in degradation of public access and nearshore infrastructure. Coastlines along West Maui and O`ahu’s North Shore have become particularly stricken by the loss of coastal public trust lands and damage to backshore assets. An aggressive episode of coastal erosion in early 2022 critically undermined one single family home, leading to its collapse and deposition of dangerous debris along Pupukea Beach Park. The collapse followed four years of a progressively worsening combination of chronic and seasonal erosion between Rocky Point and Sunset Beach Park in Paumalu that has become a focal point, highlighting the need for improved management and retreat strategies. In West Maui, chronic erosion along stretches of Ka`anapali and Kahana have spurred the development of several beach and dune restoration projects with the goal of serving as natural buffers to ongoing erosion. Similarly, the degradation of coastal areas along West Maui has become a flashpoint for debate regarding public access rights to public trust.\\n---\\nresources, private property rights, and environmentally appropriate coastal management strategies. Seasonal erosion along Ka`anapali in Summer 2022 exceeded recent historical records, revealing derelict erosion control efforts such as sandbags and highway barriers placed during the summer of 2007. The 2022 summer erosion resulted in the loss of trees and undermined the concrete beachwalk. Although the area is experiencing seasonal recovery, the shoreline has migrated mauka and similar erosion events can be expected in the future.\\n\\nThe impacts of coastal erosion on the state highway system are also significant. Hawai`i Department of Transportation (HDOT) Highways is proposing revetments in at least two locations along the Kamehameha Highway on O`ahu to protect the threatened roadway. On Maui, HDOT-Highways proposes to move portions of Honoapi`ilani Highway inland as a sea level rise adaptation. HDOT-Highways is also exploring the use of sand-savers and a revetment to protect against future erosion events in Wailua, Kaua`i and along the Windward O`ahu coastline.\\n\\nViewer Updates and Guidance Documents\\n\\nThe State of Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Viewer (Viewer) is the online atlas that supports the 2017 Report. The Viewer is designed to be useful for policy makers, government officials, and the public. There is an ongoing effort to refine the Viewer to continually provide the best available information to the users and stay in line with current science, observations, and projections. This section provides an overview of updates made to the Viewer to-date and modeling upgrades in progress to further refine the information provided by the Viewer.\\n\\nIn November 2018, the disclaimer text was updated in the Report and Viewer with the State Climate Commission’s approval, stating that “having gone through peer review and publication in the Nature Journal Scientific Reports, the results of this study are sufficiently validated to be appropriately used in land management decisions as the best available information…”\\n\\nIn 2020, the State published the Sea Level Rise Report Addendum: Guidance for Using the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area in Local Planning and Permitting Decisions as a supplement to the 2017 Report. The Addendum was prepared by the University of Hawai`i Sea Grant College Program with the Hawai`i Department of Land and Natural Resources - Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands for the Hawai`i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission - Climate Ready Hawai`i Initiative. The Hawai`i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission issued a statement of approval for the Addendum at its October 28, 2020 meeting.\\n\\nThe primary purpose of the Addendum is to assist state and county planners, natural resource and infrastructure managers, and others with understanding and using the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area (SLR-XA) from the Report and Viewer in day-to-day planning and permitting decisions, particularly at the project or property-level scale. This guidance was developed in response to requests from county planning departments and other stakeholders to provide information on how to appropriately interpret and apply the SLR-XA map data in land use planning and permitting decisions while increasing understanding of the methods, assumptions, and limitations of the data.\\n---\\n## Updates to the Viewer\\n\\nWithin the Viewer, several updates to the supporting text and available layers were completed since 2017 with the goal of making the tool more accessible and useful to users:\\n\\n- An address and TMK search tool and a TMK Parcels boundary layer were added in response to the Disclosure Requirement for Residential Real Estate in the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area. These updates were made as a result of discussions with the Hawai`i Realtors Association to enable meaningful implementation of the requirement beginning in May 2022.\\n- A passive flooding exposure layer at 6 feet of sea level rise from NOAA was added in support of planning guidance to consider greater than 3.2 ft of sea level rise for critical infrastructure.\\n- Layers depicting moku and ahupua`a boundaries were added to support visualization and understanding of sea level rise hazards in a community and cultural context.\\n- A 1%-Annual-Chance Coastal Flood Hazard Zone with Sea Level Rise layer from the Hawai`i State Hazard Mitigation Plan was added to depict changing coastal flood hazard risks with less frequent but more severe storm and wave events.\\n- A Land Use Districts layer was added in support of community planning for sea level rise.\\n- The text within the section titled “Sea Level Rise Projections for Modeling” was updated with the latest science.\\n- Text describing Assumptions and Limitations for the SLR-XA and three component models: Passive Flooding, Annual High Wave Flooding, and Coastal Erosion were added to improve understanding and transparency.\\n\\nAs sea level rise science and projections continue to evolve, the Viewer will be updated to incorporate new data and subsequent model outputs. The Coastal Erosion exposure map data in the Viewer was updated for Kaua`i, O`ahu, and Maui in 2020 by the University of Hawai`i Coastal Geology Group. However, the combined SLR-XA was not updated accordingly. A timeline and outline for implementation of a fully updated version of the Viewer is included in the Next Steps and Future Recommendations Section at the end of this report.\\n\\nThe Viewer was updated to provide specific local data for West Maui in the West Maui Wave Flooding Tool and Wave Runup Forecast Tool.\\n\\n## Other Related Guidance and Tools\\n\\nIn addition to the Viewer, the State has published other related guidance and tools building on the 2017 Report.

The recommendations were focused on improving our capacity to address the social, economic, and environmental impacts of sea level rise. Over the past 5 years, the legislature and various state and county agencies undertook several initiatives which align with the recommendations and goals set out in the 2017 Report. This section provides an overview of the status of those recommendations and associated recommended actions. Several of the initiatives are in progress or are ongoing efforts to continually adjust and address the threats of sea level rise and coastal erosion. In many cases, an initiative may address more than one recommendation or recommended actions. In those cases, the initiative is listed under each recommended action it addresses to give a complete picture of the state’s progress towards meeting the goals of the 2017 Report.\\n\\nEach recommendation and recommended action listed here will be noted with either a description of how it has been addressed, the ongoing efforts to address it, or flagged as unaddressed. All existing recommendations should be continued to the 2027 Report, with a few updates as detailed in the Further Recommendations Section towards the end of this report. The 2017 Report contains detailed descriptions and reasoning for each recommendation; readers can refer to that report for further information regarding the purpose and goal of the recommendations. This Report does not provide an assessment of the reduction in vulnerability as a factor of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity in response to the actions taken.\\n\\n## Progress Towards Meeting 2017 Recommendations:\\n\\nA summary of the progress towards meeting the recommendations and recommended actions is presented here as measured on a qualitative scale of “no known progress” to “significant progress” as depicted by the following key:\\n---\\n## No Known Progress\\n\\n|Starting Progress|Some Progress|Significant Progress|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Support sustainable and resilient land use and community development:| | |\\n\\n- 1.1 Recognize the SLR-XA as a state-wide vulnerability zone:\\n\\n- The State has not officially adopted SLR-XA as a statewide vulnerability zone but has made a number of important steps including the following:\\n\\n- The Hawai`i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission adopted the Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report (and recommendations therein) and the Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Viewer following their completion in December 2017, recognizing the SLR-XA as a statewide vulnerability zone.\\n\\n- The State Climate Commission adopted Recommendations for Countering Impacts of Sea Level Rise (September 2018) including the following recommended strategies:\\n\\n- Support legislation for disclosure for private property and public offerings located in areas with potential exposure to sea level rise.\\n- Request all new development, redevelopment and modifications be directed away from beach areas.\\n- Urge counties to incorporate the 3.2 ft. sea level rise exposure area (SLR-XA) into their general and development plans.\\n- Encourage agencies and non-governmental utility providers to identify and prioritize assets within the 3.2 ft SLR-XA or more as described in the State’s Sea Level Rise report, identify adaptation measures, and to provide a status update on this activity annually to the Climate Commission.\\n- Support legislation that funds State programs to meet mitigation goals, and to bring resources to assist in planning and implementation for sea level rise and other climate related impacts.\\n\\n- Honolulu Mayor Directive 18-02 (July 16, 2018) requires all City departments to use the most current versions of the City Climate Change Commission’s Guidance and accompanying Brief, and the 2017 Report and associated Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Viewer as resources for managing assets, reviewing permitting requests, and assessing project proposals.\\n\\n- City Climate Change Commission Sea Level Rise Guidance (2017, updated in 2022) builds on findings of the 2017 Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Report and recent scientific literature to provide specific policy and planning guidance on responding to sea level rise by the City.\\n\\n- A Maui Mayoral Proclamation (February 22, 2018) directs County departments to use the 2017 State Sea Level Rise Report, Viewer, and SLR-XA in their plans, programs, and capital improvement decisions.\\n---\\n## County of Kaua\\'i incorporated SLR-XA into West Kaui\\'i Community Plan\\n\\n1.2 Seek opportunities to plan new development outside of the SLR-XA under long-term, comprehensive managed retreat strategy\\n\\n- OPSD-CZM published a report titled Assessing the Feasibility and Implications of Managed Retreat Strategies for Vulnerable Coastal Areas in Hawai\\'i in 2019 and is embarking on a next-step study that will assess the options for and implications of implementing managed retreat from the perspectives of (1) policy and regulation, and (2) funding and financing mechanisms in 2023.\\n- Act 223, SLH2022 expands the authority of the counties to transfer development rights to address areas at risk of sea level rise, coastal erosion, storm surge, or flooding associated with climate change.\\n- The 2022 Draft update to the City and County of Honolulu Primary Urban Center Development Plan includes a Sea Level Rise and Coastal Hazards Planning Chapter and states Goal SLR-2: Conduct Long-Range Planning to Increase Area-Wide Adaptation and Resilience; Policy SLR 2.1: Plan for priority growth areas outside of the 3.2’ SLR-XA and 6’ SLR, and vent proposed solutions for highly impacted areas with the community.\\n- Bill 10 (2022) currently before the Honolulu City Council, Relating to Use Regulations would further expand the authority of Honolulu City and County to use transfer of development rights to support retreat from areas at risk of flooding and coastal erosion.\\n- Molokai Climate Change and Sea-Level Rise Adaptation and Resiliency (CCSLAR) Master Plan is a community-led climate change & sea-level rise plan for Molokai\\'s future. Our overarching goal is to develop a Climate Change and Sea Level Adaptation and Resiliency (CCSLAR) Plan that best serves our Molokai community. It identifies areas at risk from sea level rise and areas for potential relocation.\\n- West Maui Community Plan (effective January 31, 2022) Section 2 Policies, Goal 2.1 Ready and Resilient Systems includes the following:\\n- 2.1.1 | Proposed Community Plan Amendments for new development on existing golf course land in Kā‘anapali makai of Honoapi‘ilani Highway should be approved only for existing shoreline development that is retreating inland because of impacts from sea level rise or other coastal hazards.\\n- 2.1.2 | To minimize impacts from future coastal erosion, new permanent structures must be located landward of the State-recognized SLR-XA for coastal erosion, except a minimum buildable area must be provided. This restriction does not apply to structures needed as part of an approved beach restoration project or cultural project, such as loko i‘a, and which must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\\n- 2.1.3 | For redevelopment and new developments within the SLR-XA, developers must proactively: a. Coordinate with the Maui County Department of Planning and adjacent or nearby property owners to understand possible collective relocation of at-risk structures; b. Incorporate results of coordination into development plans by siting any new planned structures out of harm’s way; c. Make efforts to not hold the County of Maui and State of Hawai‘i liable for any and all future costs associated with maintaining or protecting the property developed within the SLR-XA, including costs associated with retreat, hazard mitigation, and cleanup costs to maintain the health of the nearshore marine environment from material debris originating from the ocean or from the\\n---\\n## structures’ own erosion; and d. Make efforts to waive the ability to ever request shoreline hardening for their property or project from the County of Maui or the State of Hawai‘i.\\n\\nThe County of Maui adopted a Managed Retreat Revolving Fund in 2022 to take effect in July 2023. The fund is intended to help Maui homeowners manage coastal erosion and address climate change. The fund will specifically support shoreline improvements and the in-land relocation of infrastructure owned by the county and private entities. The money will come from 20% of the county\\'s transient accommodations tax.\\n\\nWest Kaua`i Community Plan (adopted 2020)\\n\\n- Includes Objectives (page 65) to provide a higher elevation area for property owners with vulnerable homes to retreat to in the future via transfer of development rights or land swap opportunities and that evacuated land serves as a buffer against future coastal hazards.\\n- Encourages new development outside of the SLR-XA through zoning amendments. Several implementation zoning amendments were also approved with the plan document. This included ZA-2020-9, which established a new special treatment district called “ST-Coastal Edge” in the CZO. The new district was implemented in all residential neighborhoods vulnerable to sea level rise and located makai of a public road. Any use, structure, or development permitted with or without a Use Permit in the Special Treatment Coastal Edge District shall mitigate impacts from coastal hazards.\\n- Identifies managed retreat as a priority as reflected in Resiliency Policy #1: Adapt West Kauai’s low lying neighborhoods for climate change impacts and lay the groundwork for managed retreat\\n\\n## 1.3 Conduct an inventory of existing lands designated for urban use that are located outside of the SLR-XA and prioritize these areas for new development\\n\\nThe 2022 Draft of the revised Primary Urban Center Plan for the City and County of Honolulu includes the following Growth and Development Policy Goal: Invest in long-term growth in commercial corridors and mixed-density neighborhoods outside of the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area (SLR-XA).

Actions planned through this proposal include identification of specific decision-making roadblocks and possible resolutions through 1) review of state and county regulations & 2) proposed revisions to facilitate consistent land use decisions that ensure the inclusion of current and projected environmental conditions, coastal hazard risks, and types of development. CZM will collaborate with county planning departments, OCCL, HI-EMA, NOAA OCM and USACE. The proposal is designed to obtain alignment of agency responses to chronic coastal hazards and provide homeowners/developers/planners with predictability on what mitigation strategies are acceptable. The Silver Jackets team acknowledges that this proposal may not allow for resolved decision-making for all of Hawaii’s diverse coastal\\n---\\n## geologies, hydrodynamics, and development patterns and will work collectively towards identifying highest priority typologies.\\n\\n- 9.3 Develop a multi-agency, multi-media, and multi-stakeholder education and outreach program as part of a long-term commitment to building an informed and active constituency on climate change mitigation and adaptation\\n- The Hawai`i Climate Change Portal hosted by the Climate Commission hosts a consolidated inventory of climate adaptation and mitigation documents and tools.\\n- 9.4 Develop a monitoring and evaluation plan with benchmarks and indicators to support the 5-year update process\\n- No known action.\\n\\n## Further Recommendations and Next Steps\\n\\nAs we continue to make progress towards achieving the recommendations set forth in the 2017 Report, we must also focus on realigning our path and goals to continue to progress over the next five years. This includes proposing updated recommendations to guide State and County Agencies in continued planning and implementation of sea level rise related adaptation and mitigation efforts, as well as identification of new and unmet needs. Together, the updated recommendations and identification of unmet needs present a roadmap for bridging to a next-generation State of Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Viewer and a comprehensive update to the Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report in five years.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\nThe accomplishments achieved since 2017 provide a solid foundation for continued action for the state to meet the challenges and impacts of sea level rise. All 2017 recommendations and recommended actions should be continued over the next five years, with some minor edits and additions as outlined below. This report includes new recommended actions that align with existing recommendations from the 2017 Report and updates to some 2017 recommended actions.\\n\\nThis section presents the following:\\n\\n- Two new recommendations, labeled as 2022 Recommendations, with associated Recommended Actions, labeled as 2022 Recommended Actions,\\n- One updated 2017 Recommendation, labeled as Updated 2017 Recommendation with three associated updated 2017 Recommended Actions, labeled as Updated 2017 Recommended Actions,\\n- Thirteen new Recommended Actions aligned with 2017 Recommendations, labeled as 2022 Recommended Actions.\\n\\n## 2022 Recommendation 1: Conduct a full update of the Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report in 2027.\\n\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 1.1: Develop a next-generation State of Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Viewer and complete a more extensive update of the Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report in 2027 utilizing the latest and best-available climate change and sea level rise\\n---\\n## scientific information and sea level rise exposure map data\\n\\n(e.g., Climate Resilience Collaborative at the University of Hawai\\'i). The state should allocate funding to complete a comprehensive report in 2027 with a focus on community-level impacts and actions and implementation of identified adaptation recommendations from 2017. This recommendation builds on the existing mandate for a review and update every five years by proposing that the 2027 Report include a full vulnerability assessment and documentation of ongoing initiatives to reduce vulnerability and increase resiliency and adaptation. Contracting and drafting for the 2027 Report should begin at least two years in advance of the reporting deadline mandated by Act 32, SLH2017. Current progress towards developing the next-generation Sea Level Rise Viewer is detailed in the Next Steps Section, below.\\n\\n### 2022 Recommended Action 1.2: Develop a centralized tracking system\\n\\nto coordinate all efforts that are responsive to the 2017 and 2022 Report Recommendations. Establish a position within DLNR, in coordination with the Climate Commission, to improve cooperation and coordination between State and county agencies for all issues relating to sea level rise mitigation and adaptation, and to raise the visibility and understanding of these efforts to the public and across the state and county government agencies. The state should create a reporting tool potentially housed by the State Climate Commission, to consolidate reporting of progress towards meeting the objectives and recommendations of the 2017 Report and this Update. Ongoing accounting for the initiatives and progress from state and county agencies will enable greater visibility between agencies and will support the completion of the 2027 Report. This Recommended Action also aligns with 2017 Recommended Action 9.4 Develop a monitoring and evaluation plan with benchmarks and indicators to support the 5-year update process.\\n\\n### 2022 Recommended Action 1.3: Identify emerging issues and unmet needs for sea level rise adaptation and mitigation\\n\\nnot addressed by the 2017 Report. State and county agencies, in coordination through the State Climate Change Commission, should review current and ongoing initiatives to determine unaddressed issues for consideration in the 2027 Report.\\n\\n### 2022 Recommended Action 1.4: Conduct an updated and more detailed vulnerability assessment within the SLR-XA\\n\\nAs part of the 10-Year Update the state should conduct a full review of all actions taken in response to these recommendations and the 2017 recommendations to determine the changes in vulnerability within the SLR-XA as a factor of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The vulnerability assessment should include a detailed analysis of socio-economic factors including community sensitivity and adaptive capacity.\\n\\n## 2022 Recommendation 2: Continue to implement the 2017 Recommendations with minor edits\\n\\nas outlined in the 2022 Report Update.\\n\\n### 2022 Recommended Action 2.1: Identify gaps in progress since 2017\\n\\nState agencies should work towards completing and where necessary, revising the recommendations from the 2017 Report with a particular focus on areas where significant progress is lacking in the past five years. The state should ensure that agencies are adequately resourced to implement programs and policies to address the increased risk of sea level rise.\\n\\n## 2017 Recommendation 1: Support sustainable and resilient land use and community development\\n\\n### Updated 2017 Recommended Action 1.1: Recognize the SLR-XA as a statewide exposure zone\\n\\nThe phrase “vulnerability zone” should be replaced with “exposure zone” to more accurately\\n---\\nreflect what the SLR-XA depicts. Vulnerability within the exposure area can be reduced through adaptation measures for infrastructure that cannot be moved. Although all infrastructure within the SLR-XA is vulnerable to sea level rise, several factors can impact the extent of vulnerability or resiliency.\\n\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 1.7: Update planning guidance to reflect most recent sea level rise projections:\\nFollowing the latest Sweet, et al., 2022 NOAA-interagency sea level rise report, the state should set a revised planning and policy benchmark of 4 ft as the minimum scenario for all planning and design based on the report’s Intermediate (mid-range) scenario for Hawai`i of 3.9 feet of sea level rise by 2100, and apply a 6 ft benchmark for planning and design of public infrastructure projects and other projects with low tolerance for risk based on the report’s Intermediate High scenario for Hawai`i of 5.9 feet of sea level rise by 2100. The latest science suggests that the SLR-XA for 3.2ft of sea level remains valid as a planning overlay for the mid-century at this time. The State should continue to use the 3.2 foot Sea Level Rise Exposure (SLR-XA) and NOAA 6 foot passive flooding map data available in the Viewer until updated SLR-XA data is available. Agencies should incorporate the revised planning benchmarks into adaptation planning to account for the more accurate regional projections prior to the availability of revised SLR-XA data as possible. This recommendation is consistent with recent recommendations from the City and County of Honolulu Climate Change Commission which recommends an increase from 3.2 feet of sea level rise by 2100.\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 1.8: Implement the recommendations of the February 2019 Office of Planning and Sustainable Development - Coastal Zone Management Program report titled “Assessing the Feasibility and Implications of Managed Retreat Strategies for Vulnerable Coastal Areas in Hawai`i”: The state should establish and fund programs at the state and county level to incentivize relocation (e.g., willing-seller managed retreat) to benefit community resilience and protect public trust resources. Such programs include the ongoing work to:\\n- Expand the State’s and counties’ ability to implement voluntary managed retreat “tools” including but not limited to transfer of development rights (TDRs), rolling easements, and land transfers;\\n- Review state and county land use to determine where it may be possible to retreat to, i.e, “receiving areas”;\\n- Engage communities to obtain their input and priorities for retreat location strategies;\\n- Identify and establish federal, state, and county funding for retreat and restoration of coastal lands to natural conditions or lightly developed parklands for public benefit of conserving shoreline access and improving community resilience;\\n- Review state and county plans to determine where they may be amended and updated to support retreat;\\n- Review laws and regulations that may have to be amended and adopted to facilitate retreat;\\n- Prioritize support for voluntary relocation of multi-generational shorefront landowners; and\\n- Establish managed retreat pilot implementation areas.\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 1.9: Conduct long-term strategic planning for maintenance, repair and replacement of critical infrastructure within the SLR-XA in advance of emergent need: State\\n---\\nagencies should undertake long-term strategic planning initiatives to reduce the use of emergency measures for maintenance and repair of facilities and infrastructure within the SLR-XA. Emergency authorizations and implementation of adaptation measures reduce public input to the planning and permitting process. While immediate emergency action is sometimes necessary for public health and safety, it should not be used to circumvent public involvement. Proactive and comprehensive long-term planning for sea level rise impacts prior to emergency situations is necessary to safeguard natural resources while ensuring ongoing maintenance and potentially relocation of critical infrastructure. Accurate SLR-XA data available via the Viewer provides an advanced look at future sea level conditions and is a key planning tool for applying planning benchmarks outlined in this report.\\n\\n2017 Recommendation 2: Prioritize smart urban redevelopment outside the SLR-XA and limit exposure within the SLR-XA\\n\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 2.10.1 Incorporate existing and emerging scientific data in updates to shoreline setback ordinances: The state should support the counties in updating shoreline setback and zoning ordinances to reflect the increasing threat of coastal erosion and sea level rise.\\n\\n2017 Recommendation 3: Incentivize improved flood risk management; Recommended Action 3.1\\n\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 3.1.1: Improve guidelines and regulations for planning and design in the SLR-XA and FEMA Special Flood Hazard Zones: Establish a position within DLNR, in coordination with the Climate Commission, to improve cooperation and coordination between State and county floodplain management and planning departments to integrate sea level rise considerations into floodplain management and hazard mitigation.\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 3.1.2 Utilize passive flooding and wave runup model projections in building and zoning ordinances (e.g., “Constraint District”): The state should support counties in updating zoning ordinances and building codes to incorporate model projections of passive flooding and wave runup.\\n\\nUpdated 2017 Recommendation 4: Enable legacy beaches to persist with sea level rise;\\n\\n- Updated 2017 Recommended Action 4.1: Conduct a state-wide assessment of beaches applying the objectives of the Hawai`i Coastal Zone Management Act (HRS §205A-2). The DLNR, Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands (OCCL), together with federal, state, and county governments, nongovernmental organizations, and local stakeholders, should undertake a state-wide assessment to identify beaches and dune systems that are important for recreational uses, cultural practices, wildlife habitat, and coastal resilience. The state should further coordinate with county agencies to prohibit development in such areas, and even consider removing development from areas with upland sand deposits if we hope to retain this vital natural and cultural resource for future generations.\\n- Updated 2017 Recommended Action 4.2: Establish a “willing seller” program to move development away from beaches: The State should establish a “willing seller” program that pre-identifies property owners that would be willing to sell or relocate their property outside of the\\n---\\nstate-wide vulnerability zone. There are many successful examples of “willing seller” programs, the most notable of which is the City of Portland, Oregon’s “Johnson Creek Willing Seller Program” which helps move people and property out of areas that frequently flood. Restoration projects on land acquired through the program increase flood storage, improve fish and wildlife habitat, restore wetlands, and create passive recreational activities for city residents. For more information regarding this program, please visit https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/article/106234.\\n\\nUpdated 2017 Recommended Action 4.3: Explore legislative and policy mechanisms to designate funding for priority coastal lands and enable the use of a variety of practices and tools and utilize existing programs to acquire beaches and other coastal lands for recreational, cultural, ecosystem and resilience objectives: The state and counties should consider additional legislative actions to identify a dedicated sources of funding for coastal land acquisition. The state should further pursue opportunities to leverage programs such as the Federal Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program, as detailed in the Hawai`i Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Plan, and other federal or state land acquisition grant programs as they become available to acquire coastal property for conservation purposes. In addition to land acquisition for beaches, a variety of tools, including buffer zones and conservation easements, are needed to support conservation of coastal lands through incremental changes in the shoreline. Buffer zones could be used to restrict development within specified distances of natural and cultural resources. Expanding buffer zones around beaches, sand dunes, and coastal wetlands would provide space for these environments to migrate landward with rising sea levels. State law authorizes public bodies and nonprofit organizations to hold conservation easements for the purposes of preserving and protecting open space, natural landscapes, cultural and historical sites and resources, and agricultural lands.\\n\\n2022 Recommended Action 4.4: Support County Parks Departments in the management of county beach parks. The State should coordinate closely with the County Parks Departments to ensure that beach parks are managed holistically and with natural resource protection as a key priority. Beach Parks present the best opportunity for the preservation of public access and conservation of natural shorelines and beach habitat.\\n\\n2017 Recommendation 6: Protect nearshore water quality from sea level rise impacts\\n\\n2022 Recommended Action 6.1.1: Support research and development efforts to identify and implement affordable alternatives to cesspools in shoreline areas: Following on the outcomes of the cesspool conversion working group, the state should sponsor research and development efforts to expand affordable and actionable conversion options for shoreline property owners. Such options should account for SLR-XA projections of coastal erosion and associated land loss, and potential failure of onsite sewage treatment systems resulting from SLR-induced groundwater inundation. Removal of cesspools is imperative to the health of nearshore waters for all properties within the SLR-XA and for members of the public accessing coastal resources. Removal may not be achievable by 2050 as directed by state law without viable alternatives for replacement.\\n\\n2022 Recommended Action 6.4: Develop clear policy and guidance for onsite sewage disposal systems in the sea level rise exposure area to protect public health: The state should expand policy directives beyond the existing income tax credits and requirement for removal by 2050. Specifically, policy must address existing cesspools in the coastal zone in relation to\\n---\\n## Recommendation 7: Develop innovative and sustainable financing and incentives to support adaptation to sea level rise\\n\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 7.6: Explore the use of the FEMA funding for use in Hawai`i: The state should explore FEMA funding options to support moving homeowners away from flood zones in support of a comprehensive managed retreat plan. Specifically work with FEMA for Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grants, hazard mitigation programs and other funding opportunities to identify options for federal support to Hawaii’s adaptation priorities. Additionally, the state should work with federal representatives to explore exemptions from prohibitive FEMA policies, particularly on DHHL Land where the lessee model may prohibit individuals from participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\\n\\n## 2017 Recommendation 9: Promote collaboration and accountability for adapting to sea level rise\\n\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 9.5: Incorporate community-scale vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning into the 2027 Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report. The state should develop detailed and comprehensive community-based climate change and sea level rise vulnerability assessments and adaptation strategies that prioritize areas experiencing the most immediate and severe impacts with early and continuous community engagement and input.\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 9.6: Improve cooperation between state and county government agencies to strengthen enforcement and compliance with existing coastal laws. The state should encourage and support its agencies to cooperate across jurisdictional frameworks and with the counties’ various agencies to manage coastal resources. The state should encourage progressive action by its agencies to enforce coastal conservation laws and public and private compliance with coastal conservation laws. For county agencies that have conducted vulnerability assessments for their sectors, the state should review the assessments for consistency and consolidate them to comprehensively visualize and track vulnerabilities across the state.\\n- 2022 Recommended Action 9.7: Increase state agency capacity to enforce existing laws and regulations. The state should prioritize enforcement and compliance for natural resource protection by increasing staffing in regulatory, legal and enforcement agencies.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nAs an immediate next step, the State Climate Commission should adopt this report and forward it to the Legislature.\\n\\nIn addition to the recommendations listed above, the process of preparing this report has identified the following unmet needs and areas in need of focus in the next five years.\\n---\\n## Facilitate interagency coordination for holistic adaptation planning\\n\\n(e.g., comprehensive consideration and planning for natural resources, roads, communities; and improved communications between government agencies) (2017 Recommendation 9, 2022 Recommendation 1)\\n\\n## Conserve and adapt Native Hawaiian cultural resources and sites\\n\\n(2017 Recommendation 5)\\n\\n## Integrate equity and justice considerations to vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning and actions\\n\\n(2017 Recommendation 2)\\n\\n## Address and stop the loss of shoreline access\\n\\n(2017 Recommendation 4)\\n\\n## Integrate economic valuation and ecosystem co-benefits of natural coastal resources into planning and actions\\n\\n(2017 Recommendations 4, 5 and 8)\\n\\n## Make managed retreat a viable option and identify funding mechanisms for adaptation\\n\\n(2017 Recommendations 2 and 7)\\n\\n## Implement phased adaptation to sea level rise\\n\\n(2017 Recommendation 1, 2, 7)\\n\\nThe Climate Commission should set these unmet needs as priority action areas from 2023-2027. To facilitate coordination among state agencies, the Commission should host a staff-level workshop or series of workshops for discussion of this report and the actions for each agency going forward. Such a workshop will set the agenda for the next five years, create a mechanism to ensure ongoing interagency collaboration, and provide a baseline for action.\\n\\n## Next Steps for the SLR Viewer\\n\\nTo increase our ability to plan for sea level rise, The Climate Resilience Collaborative at the University of Hawai`i is working to update and expand the State of Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Viewer. Utilizing federal funding, researchers are developing the next generation of passive flooding, high wave flooding, coastal erosion, compound events, and other relevant sea level rise exposure map data that will be available in three to five years. Specific elements of the work towards as Sea Level Rise Viewer 2.0 are as follows:\\n\\n- Augment existing imagery database and increase spatial and temporal resolution of coastline observations by incorporating imagery from satellites and small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS or drones). This will allow for enhanced detail in analyses and modeling. Calculating historical rates of shoreline change with increased precision will improve future predictions of shoreline locations.\\n- The USGS-developed Coastal Storm Modeling System - Coastal On-line Assimilated Simulation Tool (CoSMos-COASTS) is being adapted to Hawai`i-specific wave conditions, and future sea level rise projections to emulate how the ocean behaves in the near shore environment in two directions – along-shore and cross-shore to expand on the existing SLR-XA modeling.\\n\\nDevelopment of a full transect grid along the islands’ coastlines, including digitizing the shoreline and identifying non-erodible areas, as well as correctly classifying beach types and littoral cell boundaries for the CoSMos-COASTS model. This team is also working to set up the framework for collecting LandSat, Sentinel, and Planet Labs satellite imagery through the CoastSat package, written by Kilian Vos (UNSW).\\n\\nCollecting aerial imagery and modeling the Island of Oʻahu in phases. Orthomosaics have been generated for some areas in the islands, the shoreline positions have been\\n---\\ndigitized and beach width determined, and historical and future shoreline change rates and hazard zones have been produced. Finally, aerial surveys are being conducted of all the shorelines. The current SLR viewer has given the state of Hawai`i an opportunity to look ahead and understand the risks of sea level rise well into the future. In a collaborative effort, this new research will help to provide improved estimates of future shoreline positions for all beaches in Hawai`i with increased spatial and temporal accuracy. Ultimately, these predicted shoreline positions will continue to inform policy decisions for shoreline management, and community resilience for the State. With this knowledge, as the state adapts to higher sea levels, priority should be given to adaptation tools that protect, and enhance the public coastal resources and access. It is critical that developments, and redevelopments be sited and designed to not require future protection that may alter a natural shoreline.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAs sea level rise continues to accelerate, the State of Hawai`i must maintain a constant and ongoing effort to adopt policies and programs to support adaptation to a changing world. Although there has been progress made towards reducing vulnerability and enhancing adaptability, we must maintain a diligent focus on continual and ongoing improvement of community engagement, laws, regulations, and policies to meet the challenge ahead and safeguarding our cultural and natural resources while also providing adaptation tools to the people of Hawai`i in an equitable manner. The recommendations contained in the 2017 Report and this update provide key steps towards increasing the islands’ resiliency to sea level rise and many of the recommended actions provide co-benefits such as mitigating impacts from storms and tsunami and improving overall community vitality. In the next five years, the state must continue to work towards identifying and implementing programs which sustain vibrant communities while improving resilience to sea level rise and mitigating other natural hazards.\\n---\\n## Works Cited\\n\\nArias, P.A., et al.

In Press.\\n---\\n## Appendix A\\n\\nResponses to Learning Questions from the 2017 Hawai`i Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report\\n\\n### Sea Level Rise Outlook: Global and Local Observations and Projections\\n\\n1. What are the observations of change in sea level in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands, and how do they correspond with the recent global acceleration in mean sea level rise?\\n\\nLong-term observational data from local tide gauge stations show that sea level is rising around Hawai‘i. Models indicate that Hawai‘i and other tropical Pacific sites will experience sea level rise that is 16% to 20% higher than the global average (Sweet. et al. 2022). The NOAA 2022 report provides a range of regionalized sea level rise scenarios based on differing GHG emissions pathways and associated global warming and ice sheet melt. The report finds that sea level will rise around Hawaii between 0.7 and 1.5 feet by 2050. The Intermediate (mid-range) estimate is for a rise of 1.0 feet (relative to sea level in the year 2000). The observed rate of sea level rise measured from tide gauges in Hawaii lead to a median estimate of 0.8 feet by 2050, though this rate is expected to accelerate in coming decades similar to global trends. Sea level will rise between 1.3 and 8.0 feet by 2100 (relative to the year 2000) with an Intermediate estimate of 3.9 feet (Sweet, et al. 2022).\\n\\n2. To what extent has the magnitude and timing of the sea level rise projections from IPCC AR5 changed with new projections from the IPCC AR6?\\n\\nSea level rise exposure mapping in the 2017 Hawai‘i Sea Level Rise Report and Hawaii Sea Level Rise Viewer is based on an upper-end projection in the 2013 IPCC 5th Assessment Report of 3.2 feet of global mean sea level rise by 2100. As expected, the science on sea level rise observations and forecasts has continued to advance. Since completion of the 2017 Report, peer-reviewed scientific literature as well as government and multinational reports increasingly point to 3 to 4 feet of sea level rise by 2100 as a mid-range, rather than high-end, scenario for Hawai‘i.\\n\\n3. What are the observations and projections of the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones and El Niño events and their effects on coastal water levels and tidal flooding?\\n\\nMajor tropical cyclones (hurricanes) in Hawaii’s region of the Central North Pacific are much less common than in the Eastern and Western tropical Pacific. From 1991-2020, an average of 3.6 tropical storms, 1.7 hurricanes (Category 1 or above), and 0.9 major hurricanes (Category 3 or above) occurred per year in the Central Pacific (J. Marra and H. Diamond, NOAA, personal communication, November 21-22, 2022). Of particular note in the past five years, Hurricane Walaka reached Category 5 status on October 1, 2018 passing south and west of the main Hawaiian Islands but traveled directly over Kānemilohaʻi (French Frigate Shoals) in Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument as a Category 3 hurricane (source). East Island, a low-lying sand and gravel atoll island in French Frigate Shoals and an important green sea turtle nesting site, was almost completely washed away by Walaka’s waves and storm surge. Elevated sea surface temperatures in the Central North Pacific (1.0º to 1.5º Celsius above average) and low wind shear contributed to Walaka’s unusual strength (H. Diamond, NOAA, personal communication, November 21, 2022).\\n\\nWhile it\\n---\\nIt is difficult to blame climate change on a single storm event, Walaka may serve as an example of increasing tropical cyclone activity and impacts for Hawaii likely to occur in coming decades. Advancing research since the 2017 SLR Report using climate models points to similar frequency but increasing intensity of tropical cyclones around Hawaii, linked primarily to increased warming of ocean surface waters (Widlansky, et al. 2019). El Nino conditions generally mean increased occurrence of tropical storms around Hawaii. The “triple dip” La Nina conditions over the past three years has likely suppressed tropical cyclone activity around Hawaii over that time period due to cooler waters and increased windshear (changes in wind speed and direction with altitude). Record high sea levels in 2017 have been linked to delayed effects from a strong El Nino in 2015 and climate model projections point to increased periods of weak trade winds following El Nino events that have been linked to the occurrence of high sea levels around Hawaii (Long, et al. 2020).\\n\\n## Methodology\\n\\n1. To what extent do new global sea level rise projections differ from those used in this hazard modeling?\\n\\nSea level rise exposure mapping in the 2017 Hawai‘i Sea Level Rise Report and Hawaii Sea Level Rise Viewer is based on an upper-end projection in the 2013 IPCC 5th Assessment Report of 3.2 feet of global mean sea level rise by 2100. As expected, the science on sea level rise observations and forecasts has continued to advance. Since completion of the 2017 Report, peer-reviewed scientific literature as well as government and multinational reports increasingly point to 3 to 4 feet of sea level rise by 2100 as a mid-range, rather than high-end, scenario for Hawai‘i.\\n2. To what extent have data and coastal hazard modeling improved to warrant updating this hazard modeling?\\n\\nAs current science, observations and projections evolve, the University of Hawai`i Climate Resilience Collaborative is working to update and expand the State of Hawaii Sea Level Rise Viewer. Utilizing federal funding, researchers are developing the next generation of passive flooding, high wave flooding, coastal erosion, compound events and other relevant sea level rise exposure map data that will be available in three to five years.\\n3. To what extent have property values, population, and other development trajectories changed from the baseline data used in this report?\\n\\nProperty Values\\n\\nThe 2017 Report estimated that the value of private lands and structures within the SLR-XA on Oʻahu was roughly $12.9 billion. A precise answer to this question was not attainable for the purposes of this report. Calculations of the change in property value are in progress by the University of Hawaiʻi Institute for Sustainability and Resilience (ISR), led by Dr. Makena Coffman (personal communications, 2022).\\n\\nPopulation\\n\\nThe 2017 Report states that “[o]ver the next 30 to 70 years, chronic flooding with sea level rise will increase, impacting homes and businesses located near the shoreline. Approximately…19,800 people statewide would be exposed to chronic flooding in the SLR-XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise.” A precise answer to this question was not attainable for the purposes of this report. Updated population calculations are in progress by the ISR.\\n---\\n## Development\\n\\nThe 2017 Report states that “[o]ver the next 30 to 70 years, chronic flooding with sea level rise will increase, impacting homes and businesses located near the shoreline. Approximately 6,500 structures…statewide would be exposed to chronic flooding in the SLR-XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise.” Development trends throughout the state have not significantly changed since 2017, however the recent and pending updates to county SMA and shoreline setback ordinances may affect coastal development patterns moving forward.\\n\\n## Is the SLR-XA for 3.2 feet of sea level rise modeled in the Report still valid as the exposure overlay for the mid to latter half of this century?\\n\\nThe latest science suggests that the SLR-XA for 3.2ft of sea level remains valid as a planning overlay for the mid century at this time. Following the latest Sweet, et al., 2022 NOAA-interagency sea level rise report, the State should update the guidance to set a planning and policy benchmark of 4 ft for all planning and design for actions and infrastructure planned to 2100, and apply a 6 ft benchmark for planning and design of public infrastructure projects and other projects with low tolerance for risk.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n1. ### To what extent is potential chronic flooding in the SLR-XA with 1.1 foot of sea level rise aligned with areas currently exposed to chronic flooding?\\n\\nIn 2017, and again in 2020, the Honolulu Harbor Tide gauge recorded the highest daily mean water levels observed over its 112-year history. These record high water levels were produced by a combination of phenomena that included long-term global sea level rise, peak annual astronomical tides (“king tides”), wave setup, and migration of warm buoyant waters brought in by winds and currents. During both events, observed sea levels tracked between 0.5 and 1 ft higher than predicted, providing a glimpse of what will become a more common occurrence in the near future as sea level continues to rise. Flooding observed during these events was widely documented as part of the Hawai`i and Pacific Islands King Tides citizen science program. Local impacts were observed throughout the State in the form of increased coastal erosion, minor wave over-wash flooding, backshore flooding from groundwater rise and storm drain backflow, and impeded and potentially hazardous beach access. Observations in low-lying areas like Mapunapua on Oahu confirmed flooding characterized by SLR-XA passive flood layers representing the 1.1 ft scenario.\\n2. ### Are there any new developments or critical infrastructure in the SLR-XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise not accounted for in the vulnerability assessment?\\n\\nState and County updated policies are designed to reduce the building of new homes and infrastructure within the SLR-XA. In preparing this report, a full assessment of new development or critical infrastructure within the 3.2ft SLR-XA was not conducted. This report recommends a full vulnerability assessment for the 2027 Report.\\n3. ### To what extent have land and structure values for parcels in areas potentially impacted by sea level rise changed as a basis for estimating potential economic loss?\\n\\nIt is not clear that there has been any trend in shoreline development or retreat that would meaningfully change the basis for estimating economic loss in the SLR-XA since the 2017 Report.\\n---\\n#### To what extent has human migration from other Pacific Islands and wildlife migration from the NWHI to the main Hawaiian Islands changed?\\n\\nIt is unknown at this time whether there has been a change in human and wildlife migration patterns since the 2017 report.\\n\\n#### What adaptation measures have been taken to reduce vulnerability to sea level rise?\\n\\nSeveral adaptation measures have been taken throughout the state which reduce vulnerability to sea level rise. Most of these are detailed in the Recommendations section of the report, and are highlighted here briefly as specific measures which may reduce individual vulnerability to sea level rise.\\n\\nThe following is a general listing of actions which are further detailed in the Recommendations section in the body of this report:\\n\\n|County of Kauaʻi|passed first of its kind Sea Level Rise Constraint District that uses passive flooding and wave runup models developed for Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer. The constraint district is a great example of resilient design standards for proposed uses within the SLR-XA.|\\n|---|---|\\n|The state|implemented a disclosure requirement for real estate transactions for all properties located within the sea level rise exposure area.|\\n|The state|has sponsored or permitted beach nourishment activities in Waikiki and elsewhere which improve resiliency by augmenting the beach profile and replacing eroded sand onto the beach. Coupled with sand nourishment, some projects have also included groin construction in an effort to keep nourished sand on the beach.|\\n|In 2020, County of Kaua`i|established a Special Treatment Coastal Edge District (ST-CE) as areas that are highly vulnerable to coastal hazards including but not limited to sea level rise, coastal erosion, high wave run-up, passive flooding, and an increased frequency and intensity of storms. Within the ST-CE any use, structure, or development permitted with or without a Use Permit in the Special Treatment Coastal Edge District shall mitigate impacts from coastal hazards, including but not limited to sea level rise, coastal erosion, high wave run-up, passive flooding, and an increased frequency and intensity of storms.|\\n|Along the elevated portions of the Honolulu Rail Transit Project between Chinatown and Ala Moana Center|the stations were redesigned so no electronics below 6ft and elevated portions meet federal requirements even if roads are raised by 6ft. Additionally, all hanging elements were removed to allow for 6ft of adaptation.|\\n|Sidewalks and entryways in Kaka`ako|are elevated above street level to account for flooding.|\\n|The City and County of Honolulu and the Maui County|both issued Mayoral Declarations requiring executive departments to consider and incorporate SLR-XA data for capital planning.|\\n|City and County of Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting|instituted a requirement for consideration of sea level rise for all building permits and for all properties conducting renovations within the SLR-XA.|\\n\\n#### Recommendations\\n\\nWhat recommendations have been implemented and why?\\n\\nThe status of the recommendations and recommended actions contained in the 2017 Report is covered in detail in the body of this report. Progress towards meeting the nine recommendations (represented\\n---\\nby large circles) and 49 associated recommended actions (represented by small circles) is presented here as measured on a qualitative scale of “no known progress” to “significant progress”.\\n\\nsupport sustainable and resilient land use and community development\\n\\nPrioritize smart Urban redevelopment outside SLR-XA and limit exposure within the SLR-XA\\n\\nIncentivize Improved flood risk management:\\n\\nEnable legacy beaches persist with level rise,\\n\\nPreserve Native Hawaiian culture and communities with level rise.\\n\\nProtect nearshore water quality from sea level rise impacts.\\n\\nIncentivize improved flood risk management\\n\\nEnable legacy beaches persist with level rise.\\n\\nPromote collaboration and accountability for adapting level rise.\\n\\nSome key statewide accomplishments that address the recommendations are noted as follows:\\n\\nUse of the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area Data and Sea Level Rise Viewer: Although the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area (SLR-XA) was not officially recognized as a state-wide vulnerability zone, the Viewer and SLR-XA are in widespread use by state and county agencies for adaptation planning purposes. The use of the SLR-XA data as identified by the Viewer for policy decisions was enabled by the peer reviewed publication of the methods, which allowed for the removal of the original disclaimer language cautioning against such use. Easy availability and the establishment of guidance for SLR-XA data interpretation via the viewer made it critically important to the success of planning efforts and new policies. We recommend a continual peer review of ongoing research to strengthen the research products used in policy decision making.\\n\\nHawai`i Coastal Zone Management Act Updates: Act 16, SLH2020 updated the Hawai`i Coastal Zone Management Act (HRS Chapter 205A) in many ways including strengthening protections for beach and\\n---\\nother coastal environments by specifically prohibiting private shoreline hardening structures and minimizing public shoreline hardening structures, including seawalls and revetments, at sandy beaches where they would interfere with existing recreational and waterline activities.\\n\\nSea Level Rise Report Addendum: Guidance for Using the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area in Local Planning and Permitting Decisions was published by the State as a supplement to the 2017 Report. The Addendum was prepared by the University of Hawai`i Sea Grant College Program with the Hawai`i Department of Land and Natural Resources - Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands for the Hawai`i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission - Climate Ready Hawai`i Initiative. The Hawai`i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission issued a statement of approval for the Addendum at its October 28, 2020 meeting.\\n\\nHawai`i 2018 Hazard Mitigation Plan: The 2018 update of the State’s Hazard Mitigation Plan includes expanded consideration of climate change and sea level rise hazards, including hazard assessment using the SLR-XA and a 1% Annual-Chance Coastal Flood Zone with 3.2 feet of sea level rise (1%CFZ-3.2) modeled for the Plan: https://dod.hawaii.gov/hiema/sert-resources/hazard-mitigation/\\n\\nPlanning for Managed Retreat: OPSD-CZM published a report titled Assessing the Feasibility and Implications of Managed Retreat Strategies for Vulnerable Coastal Areas in Hawai`i in 2019 and is embarking on a next-step study that will assess the options for and implications of implementing managed retreat from the perspectives of (1) policy and regulation, and (2) funding and financing mechanisms in 2023.\\n\\nStatewide Inventory of Vulnerable Infrastructure: Act 178 Relating to Sea Level Rise Adaptation was passed to begin the long-term planning needed to effectively address climate impacts. OPSD-CZM submitted a report to the legislature in 2021 reporting on progress towards the phased approach required by Act 178.\\n\\nIn addition to the above listed state-wide highlights, the ongoing support from University of Hawai`i entities such as the Sea Grant College Program, the Climate Resilience Collaborative, and others) to state and county agencies provided expertise for interpretation of the report and practical implementation of recommendations and use of data. The capacity to address the impacts of sea-level rise grew at county and state levels of government. For example, the City and County of Honolulu established the City and County of Honolulu established the Climate Change Commission. The City and County of Honolulu and the County of Maui established an Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency; the County of Hawaii maintains a Climate Change Action program within its Office of Research and Development and the County of Kauai maintains a Sustainability Program Area within its Office of Economic Development.\\n\\n## What recommendations have not been implemented and why?\\n\\nAlthough the state made progress towards implementing the recommendation of the 2017 Report, there are areas of unmet need that require a renewed focus over the next five years.\\n\\n- Facilitate interagency coordination for holistic adaptation planning (e.g., comprehensive consideration and planning for natural resources, roads, communities; and improved communications between government agencies) (2017 Recommendation 9, 2022 Recommendation 1)\\n- Conserve and adapt Native Hawaiian cultural resources and sites (2017 Recommendation 5)\\n---\\n### Integrate equity and justice considerations to vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning and actions (2017 Recommendation 2)\\n\\n### Address and stop the loss of shoreline access (2017 Recommendation 4)\\n\\n### Integrate economic valuation and ecosystem co-benefits of natural coastal resources into planning and actions (2017 Recommendations 4, 5, and 8)\\n\\n### Make managed retreat a viable option and identify funding mechanisms for adaptation (2017 Recommendations 2 and 7)\\n\\n### Implement phased adaptation to sea level rise (2017 Recommendation 1, 2, 7)\\n\\nThe status of the recommendations and recommended actions contained in the 2017 Report is covered in detail in the body of this report. The summary graphic in the answer to question 2 in this section captures recommendations and recommended actions for which no action and/or little progress was reported. The 2017 Recommendations were adopted by the State Climate Commission but were not specifically assigned to individual agencies for action. As a result, individual agencies prioritize and implement new programs or policies aligned with their strategic goals, and not in response to all recommendations from the 2017 Report. Overall funding and personnel capacity also hinder progress towards implementing the recommendations and recommended actions.\\n\\n### What have been barriers to implementation and measures taken to overcome these barriers?\\n\\nThe COVID pandemic caused delays to action across the federal, state, and county government agencies. Although capacity to address climate change and sea level rise increased at the state and county levels, there is a need for additional personnel and funding as outlined in the updated recommendations in this report. Additionally, specific to the implementation of progressive shoreline setback ordinances, there is a need for public engagement and education regarding the need and benefit for increased setback distances. Opposition from property rights advocates will continue to be an issue when attempting to implement stricter setback rules. There is also a lack of funding mechanisms to enable managed retreat. The ongoing work of OPSD-CZM to study the various possibilities should be supported and the findings of the initial study should be implemented.\\n\\n### To what extent has Hawaii’s capacity to adapt to sea level rise increased based on benchmarks and measurable indicators?\\n\\nAmong the updated recommendations presented in this interim report is a focus on the facilitation of interagency coordination for holistic adaptation planning and greater resources dedicated to tracking and integrating agency initiatives and efforts towards adaptation. There are currently no benchmarks or measurable indicators to measure the State’s progress towards sea level rise adaptation. In order to objectively assess Hawaii’s capacity to adapt to sea level rise, we must set benchmarks for measurement and all state and county agencies must adopt and utilize those benchmarks.\\n---\\nThis Report did not undertake an effort to assess reductions in vulnerability or increased capacity to adapt to sea level rise based on the implementation of the recommended actions. We recommend that the state should conduct a full review of all actions taken in response to the 2017 and 2022 recommendations to determine the reduction in vulnerability for areas within the exposure area as part of the 10-Year Update.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Accretion of coral and coralline algae reefs in the Hawaiian Islands today is largely controlled by wave energy. Many coastal areas in the main Hawaiian Islands are periodically exposed to large waves, in particular from North Pacific swell and hurricanes. These are of sufficient intensity to prevent modern net accretion as evidenced by the antecedent nature of the seafloor. Only in areas sheltered from intense wave energy is active accretion observed. Analysis of reef cores reveals patterns of rapid early Holocene accretion in several locations that terminated by middle Holocene time, ca. 5000 yr ago. Previous analyses have suggested that changes in Holocene accretion were a result of reef growth ‘‘catching up’’ to sea level. New data and interpretations indicate that the end of reef accretion in the middle Holocene may be influenced by factors in addition to sea level. Reef accretion histories from the islands of Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, and Moloka‘i may be interpreted to suggest that a change in wave energy contributed to the reduction or termination of Holocene accretion by 5000 yr ago in some areas. In these cases, the decrease in reef accretion occurred before the best estimates of the decrease in relative sea-level rise during the mid-Holocene high stand of sea level in the main Hawaiian Islands. However, reef accretion should decrease following the termination of relative sea-level rise (ca. 3000 yr ago) if reef growth were ‘‘catching up’’ to sea level. Evidence indicates that rapid accretion occurred at these sites in early Holocene time and that no permanent accretion is occurring at these sites today. This pattern persists despite the availability of hard substrate suitable for colonization at a wide range of depths between 30 m and the intertidal zone. We infer that forcing other than relative sea-level rise has altered the natural ability to support reef accretion on Hawaiian insular shelves. The limiting factor in these areas today is wave energy. Numbers of both large North Pacific swell events and hurricanes in Hawai‘i are greater during El Niño years. We infer that if these major reef-limiting forces were suppressed, net accretion would occur in some areas in Hawai‘i that are now wave-limited. Studies have shown that El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was significantly weakened during early-mid Holocene time, only attaining an intensity similar to the current one ca. 5000 yr ago. We speculate that this shift in ENSO may assist in explaining patterns of Holocene Hawaiian reef accretion that are different from those of the present and apparently not related to relative sea-level rise.\\n\\nThis project was funded in part by NOAA via pe Hawai‘i Coral Reef Initiative (Award no.

April 2004\\n\\nA number of researchers have reported that Holocene reef accretion in Hawai‘i has been predominantly a function of sea level and exposure to wave energy (e.g., Grigg 1998, Grossman 2001). New observations of the timing of Holocene reef accretion from several locations show that accretion leading up to middle Holocene time occurred in areas where today it is precluded by the wave regime. The dramatic decrease in accretion at these locations, occurring ca. 5000 yr ago, is insufficiently explained solely as the product of relative sea-level rise and suggests an increase in wave energy in Hawaiian waters at that time.\\n\\nEnvironmental Controls\\n\\nsea level. Relative sea level has played a dominant role in controlling reef growth in the Hawaiian Islands on scales of thousands of years. Eustatic sea level at the Last Glacial Maximum, ca. 21,000 yr ago, is estimated to have been between 113 m and 135 m below the current level (Clark et al. 2001). In Hawai‘i, as seen in Figure 1, relative sea level is believed to have risen rapidly from the Last Glacial Maximum to its current level ca. 5000 yr ago and continued rising to about 2 m above that. The Holocene highstand culminated ca. 3000 yr ago (Fletcher and Jones 1996) before dropping back down below the current level (Grossman and Fletcher 1998) before the advent of tide gauge recording.\\n\\nCoral reefs can grow in Hawai‘i only between the critical depth of 30 m (Grigg and Epp 1989) and the intertidal zone, with optimal growth occurring at about 12 m (Grigg 1998). Thus, dramatic changes in sea level during Holocene and late Pleistocene time have exerted obvious constraints on reef growth. Smaller fluctuations in sea level associated with the middle Holocene Kapapa Stand of the sea (+2 m) are proposed to have enabled and terminated reef growth by changing both the area covered by seawater and amount of wave energy able to reach specific reef areas (Grigg 1998). At current rates, relative sea-level rise ranges from 13 cm per century on the island of Kaua‘i to 32 cm per century on the island of Hawai‘i, with other locations falling between these extremes (Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level, 2003). Over periods of up to a few centuries the relatively small changes in sea level are, given the 12 m depth for optimal growth, unlikely to have substantial effects on reef growth, except in limited areas near the modern tidal range.\\n\\nwave energy. The primary factor responsible for curtailing Holocene reef growth on scales of years to as much as a few centuries is exposure to wave energy. The moderate energy provided by northeasterly trade winds and south swell usually benefits reefs in Hawai‘i by enhancing circulation and nutrient uptake (Grigg 1998). Although occasional\\n---\\n## El Nin˜o Influence on Hawaiian Reefs - Rooney et al. (Page 307)\\n\\nLarge waves generated by Kona storms (low-pressure systems that develop during the Northern Hemisphere winter) have caused damage to reefs, they are infrequent enough to be of secondary importance in limiting reef accretion (Grigg 1998).\\n\\nLong-period (12 to 20 sec) North Pacific swell on the other hand has been extensively reported to exert a substantial control on reef distribution (Grigg 1983, 1998, Storlazzi et al. 2002). Occurring during the winter season, these swells approach from a directional range of west-northwest through northeast with typical deepwater wave heights of 1.5 to 5 m, although waves as large as ca. 15 m have been reported (Bodge and Sullivan 1999).\\n\\nResearchers have also noted the reef-limiting effects of major hurricanes in Hawai‘i (Dollar 1982, Dollar and Tribble 1993, Grigg 1995, 1998). Hurricane ‘Iwa, for example, struck the Islands in 1982 and reduced reef areas with 60–100% coral cover on O‘ahu’s south shore to rubble (Grigg 1995).\\n\\nAlong the southwestern shore of Hawai‘i, both hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki (1992) destroyed stands of coral along more than 10 km of shoreline (Dollar and Tribble 1993). Most hurricanes tracking as far west as the main Hawaiian Islands pass to the south (e.g., Chu 2002).\\n\\nAs a result, hurricane-induced wave energy generally has a more severe impact on southeastern to southwestern coasts, whereas North Pacific swell predominantly impacts west- to northeast-facing shores. However, longer-period swells can refract substantial energy around to coastlines facing away from the incident wave direction (e.g., Storlazzi et al. 2002).\\n\\nTsunamis originating from within the Pacific basin, including the Hawaiian Islands, strike Hawaiian shores. A few of these since the early 1800s have had amplitudes in excess of 10 m and caused substantial damage, suggesting that high bottom shear stresses capable of breaking and scouring reef structure occur during major tsunamis.\\n\\nOne anecdotal account reported that a major tsunami several decades ago caused a substantial reduction of live coral cover on windward O‘ahu reefs (B. Kapuni, pers. comm.). This potentially substantial control on reefs in some areas has been overlooked in most of the literature. Reports tend to focus on damage occurring on land, so there are little historical data available. Hence, impacts of tsunamis on reef morphology and accretion remain an important question to be addressed.\\n\\nFrom dated core samples and interpretation of paleoecology at these sites we infer a substantial increase in wave energy in the central North Pacific starting ca. 5000 yr ago.\\n\\nMoloka‘i: The Hale o Lono and Hikauhi sites are located near the western end of Moloka‘i’s south shore and on part of the longest continuous fringing reef in the Hawaiian Archipelago (Maragos 1998). Although only 10 km apart, the sites are characterized by markedly different reef structure. Near the eastern site, Hikauhi, is a prominent gulch that drains the relatively arid watershed landward of the site and delivers substantial volumes of terrigenous mud during occasional rain events.\\n\\nLandward portions of the @0.8-km-wide reef flat have been physically buried by the influx of mud and seaward progradation of the shoreline. Low wave energy, due to both shadowing effects of the island and a shallow reef crest, prevents terrigenous mud from being effectively dispersed and reduces suspended sediment in the water column outside the reef crest.\\n\\nMost of the substrate seaward of the reef crest is covered with live coral and gradually slopes down to an abrupt drop-off at about 17 m into a large sand field at 20 m. Several outcrops a few tens of meters in diameter and with high percentages\\n---\\n## Figure 2.

It receives less terrestrial sediment in runoff than does the Hikauhi site and experiences strong tidal and longshore currents and higher wave energy, particularly in the winter season, related to refracted North Pacific swell. The site features a narrow reef flat (@0.3 km), generally sparse coral cover, and a gently sloping terrace of fossil reef from 0 to 5.5 m. This is followed seaward by a series of four shore-parallel and low-relief ridges of fossil reef separated by sand-filled channels, at depths ranging from 8.5 to 21.0 m.\\n\\nO‘ahu: Kailua Bay is an embayment 4 km long on the windward or northeastern side of O‘ahu. A fossil reef terrace extends from the sandy beach @3 km offshore, gently sloping seaward to a depth of 20 m and dropping abruptly from there to a deeper, sand-covered terrace starting at 30 m. It is exposed to trade wind swell and the more easterly of, or refracted, North Pacific swell.

Percentages of live coral cover average @20% and coral colonies appear to be no more than a few years old, with most of the hard substrate composed of fossil reef covered by a short algal turf.\\n\\nresults\\nTen cores were drilled and recovered at Hale o Lono, along a roughly shore-normal transect, at depps ranging from 5.5 to 21.0 m. The substrate gets progressively younger and shallower moving landward, ranging from an age of ca. 8100 calendar yr before present (cal. yr b.p.) at 21.0 m to ca. 4800 cal. yr b.p. at 5.5 m. The most common depositional texture of material recovered from pe cores is bindstone, wip a predominantly coralline algal matrix. Rudstone, composed of fragments of coral, coralline algae, and oper reef rubble material, is pe second most common constituent of pe cores. Bop textures indicate high-energy depositional environments (Sherman et al. 1999). Cores from 17.7 m, however, have sequences of branching framestone, in some cases topped by bindstone accreted ca. 7900 cal. yr b.p. Results of coring and analysis at Hale o Lono are summarized in Figure 3.\\n\\nAlthough the species mix is similar at Hale o Lono and Hikauhi, growth morphologies tend to be more branched or massive and less encrusting at Hikauhi, and percentages of live coral cover are much higher, averaging @70%. Twenty-four cores recovered from the Hikauhi site, at depths between 4.0 and 19.8 m, contain mostly massive coral framestone or floatstone reef material. These facies are indicative of moderate to low wave energy depositional conditions (Sherman et al. 1999, Grossman 2001). Ages of core samples from Hikauhi are much younger than those from Hale o Lono, ranging in age from modern to 910 cal. yr b.p. and yielding an overall mean accretion rate of @5 mm yr 1. Results of coring and analysis at Hikauhi are summarized in Figure 4.\\n\\n### Kailua\\n\\nGrossman (2001) divided the reef terrace in Kailua Bay into three regions based on the dominant facies in the upper 1 m of the reef surface. The north and south platforms are characterized by a fossil reef surface with an encrusting coralline algae veneer. Landward portions are karstified and often covered by sand fields, and the southern platform features scattered massive and encrusting colonies of live corals. The central platform, on the other hand, is dominated by living reef, with encrusting corals and coralline algae along the north and south margins. In the middle of the central platform, on each side of the Kawainui paleostream channel, are communities of mixed massive and encrusting corals, with branching coral communities dominating the substrate at its seaward margin.\\n\\nA selection of the 32 cores drilled through the nearshore reef platform in Kailua Bay was subsampled for radiometric dating and other analyses (Grossman 2001). Three of these, cores K20, K21, and K27, recovered from the south central platform, are of particular interest to this study and shown in Figure 5. Each of these cores is capped by thin (0.2–0.6 m) layers of bindstone, indicative of high-energy conditions. Underneath the bindstone are sequences of massive coral (core K20) or branching coral (cores K21 and K27) framestone, indicative of low to moderate and low-energy depositional environments, respectively. Underlying the branching coral framestone in core K21 are sequences of massive coral framestone interspersed with sand layers. Core K27 is too short to tell if a similar pattern exists under its location. Changes in accretion rates from\\n---\\n## El Nin ˜o Influence on Hawaiian Reefs .

These results are consistent with analyses from other areas of the carbonate terrace found around most of O‘ahu and imply a pre-Holocene age (Sherman et al. 1999, Grossman 2001). However, radiometric dating of core samples indicates that reef accretion occurred in restricted areas on the Punalu‘u reef during the Holocene.\\n\\nTen drill holes were scattered around the transect line on the reef flat.

They concluded that refraction of energy from large North Pacific swell around the east and west ends of Moloka‘i is sufficient to inhibit coral development at these locations. The gradient of bed shear stress decreases sharply going east from the southwestern corner of Moloka‘i past Hale o Lono and declines to a fraction of its former magnitude before reaching the Hikauhi site.

The trend of progressively younger material moving landward suggests that some factor was curtailing the maximum depth of accretion. We do not yet fully understand the set of conditions that led to the formation of the observed reef sequence. One possible explanation is that accretion here was marginal and could only occur in a narrow zone, limited at shallow depths by wave energy. We speculate that within this zone, light was adequate to permit sufficiently rapid accretion that some new material was left on the reef between major wave events. Today, however, wave energy from North Pacific swell is preventing reef accretion at all depths at Hale o Lono. This suggests that there was an increase in North Pacific swell activity coincident with and responsible for the cessation of accretion there ca. 5000 yr ago.\\n\\n### Ma¯na¯\\n\\nHand samples of corals were retrieved from a variety of depths along a vertical wall on the landward side of the Ma¯na¯ fossil barrier reef. Sample collection was limited to material that could be extracted quickly with hand tools. Although collected in a straight line moving up the reef face, samples lack the vertical continuity of cores. Despite these limitations, a few observations can be made. It became apparent during sample collection that at least the visible portion of the reef face is predominantly composed of in situ growth of Porites compressa coral that falls within the branching coral framestone facies described by Sherman et al. (1999) and Grossman (2001). The exposed seafloor above the barrier supports little live cover, but areas in the lee of the barrier display moderate to sparse live cover characterized by platy, encrusting, and massive morphologies. Without further data it is impossible to tell if the modern community is accreting or is just the most recent accumulation of ephemeral growth on a fossil substrate. However, the living coral community is best described as a mix of Grossman’s (2001) encrusting cor-algal bindstone and massive coral framestone facies, suggesting a moderate to high-energy setting. Collection depths and calibrated ages of dated samples are shown in Table 1.\\n\\n### discussion\\n\\nMoloka‘i\\n\\nAlthough the Hale o Lono site supported reef accretion until ca. 5000 yr ago, since then it has been unable to, despite the availability of suitable substrate and the obvious ability of corals and coralline algae to recruit there. Cores from Hikauhi, a few kilometers away, all show rapid and continual accretion over the late Holocene. This striking difference in modern reef accretion has been convincingly explained by Storlazzi et al. (2002). Using a combination of wave modeling and field observations, they found high correlations between changes in reef morphology and total coral cover versus benthic shear stress from North Pacific swell. They concluded that refraction of energy from large North Pacific swell around the east and west ends of Moloka‘i is sufficient to inhibit coral development at these locations. The gradient of bed shear stress decreases sharply going east from the southwestern corner of Moloka‘i past Hale o Lono and declines to a fraction of its former magnitude before reaching the Hikauhi site.

Cores show rapid accretion until ca. 3000 yr ago, coinciding with the peak of Holocene sea level for O‘ahu (Grossman and Fletcher 1998). That correlation breaks down in the south central part of the bay, where rapid accretion terminated at\\n---\\n## El Nin ˜o Influence on Hawaiian Reefs .

This is also the of the fossil in situ coral colony, and the lack area subject to substantially higher breaking of large corals or rubble accretion on the wave heights from North Pacific swell, which platform today, that wave energy during early led Grossman (2001) to conclude that accre- to middle Holocene time was less intensive tion in these areas has been limited by wave than currently.\\n\\nMid-Holocene accretion is also documented in a core from the reef crest, with ages ranging from 4900 to 5600 yr. Only the sample from 1.6-m core depth was from in situ material, perhaps explaining the apparent inversion in the top two dates, as seen in Table 1. Although the reef crest has the highest combined living cover of coral and coralline algae of any area at the site, evidence from the core suggests that the live community is only a thin and ephemeral coating on a fossil edifice that stopped accreting ca. 5000 yr ago. Sea level around the time the reef crest was accreting was continuing to rise (Figure 1), suggesting that other factors are responsible for the change in accretion. We hypothesize that major wave events now subject the reef crest to concussive impacts from breaking waves and severe scour, effectively inhibiting buildup of accreted material.\\n\\nHolocene accretion also occurred on the reef flat, where most of at least the top 2 m of reef flat appears to be composed of unconsolidated coral and reef rubble interspersed with sand. Reef flats have often been reported to be depositional areas, where rubble from the fore reef is deposited during large wave events (e.g., Fairbridge 1968), and this appears to be the case for Punalu‘u. Two of the three samples dated from the reef crest have ages of slightly over 5000 cal. yr b.p., with the third sample being of modern age. This may reflect a greater availability of live coral on the fore reef in mid-Holocene time, which then decreased dramatically following an increase in wave energy sufficient to prevent new accretion.\\n\\nThe cores from Punalu‘u discussed here indicate that limited accretion of coral and coralline algae reefs was occurring before approximately 5000 yr ago, possibly reflecting a lower level of incident wave energy from North Pacific swell. Although sampling is insufficient to be considered conclusive, the results thus far are consistent from cores taken\\n\\nPunalu‘u\\n\\nCorals and coralline algae are the most important reef-building organisms in Hawai‘i today, with living coral reef found at depths from about mean lower low water to 30 m (Grigg and Epp 1989). Hard substrate and relatively clear water provide habitat suitable for coral and coralline algae recruitment from the inner reef flat to the base of the fore reef, as evidenced by the presence of these organisms on all benthic surveys within the 0 to 30-m depth range at Punalu‘u. Although reef-building organisms are recruited successfully, cores indicate that reef material has been unable to accumulate permanently anywhere across the reef in the last ca. 5000 yr.\\n\\nThe lack of modern accretion found at Punalu‘u is consistent with results from cores collected elsewhere on O‘ahu (Sherman et al. 1999). These and numerous other studies mentioned here found that wave energy is the primary factor preventing reef accretion today. The Punalu‘u site is highly exposed to North Pacific swell and relatively protected from major hurricanes, which usually pass south of the Islands. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the larger North Pacific swell wave events are preventing reef accretion at this site by subjecting recent growth of corals and coralline algae to concussive impact, high shear stresses, and abrasion.\\n\\nCores indicate that a different situation existed here during the early to mid-Holocene. The composition of the reef subsurface (Figure 6) shows that during that time there was active reef accretion in three areas. The core from 11.3-m depth contains a framestone of massive in situ coral overlain by a rudstone, which is consistent with an increase in wave energy. We infer from the relatively large size of the fossil in situ coral colony, and the lack of large corals or rubble accretion on the platform today, that wave energy during early to middle Holocene time was less intensive than currently.\\n---\\n## PACIFIC SCIENCE . April 2004\\n\\nThe branching coral framestone facies of the mid-Holocene reef community is typically found in calm and low-energy fore reef or lagoonal settings (Sherman et al. 1999). In comparison, the facies characterizing the relatively sparse modern coral community is commonly found in moderate to high-energy environments. These differences do not appear to be a result of variations in sea level. Relative sea-level rise on Kaua‘i today is close to that on O‘ahu, and we assume that their sea-level histories are similar over the Holocene. Today the top of the Ma¯na¯ fossil reef complex is 15 to 18 m deep, and there is limited coral growth landward of and partially sheltered by the shallowest portion of the fossil reef. None of the live coral communities there today is similar to the vertical growths of Porites compressa that appear to be the dominant community there between ca. 5000 and 8000 yr ago. Porites compressa is the dominant coral at depths to 21 m at the Hikauhi site, where it is growing luxuriantly and is apparently limited by the lack of hard substrate from colonizing deeper areas. Dollar (1982) showed the P. compressa zone off Kailua-Kona extending to a depth of @ 30 m. The depth range at Ma¯na¯ of available substrate today extends from 15 to 30 m, so all of it is theoretically available for colonization by P. compressa. This species was able to colonize and dominate the reef community there at depths, corrected using the O‘ahu sea-level curve, between 13 and 22 m until ca. 5000 yr ago. Sea level 7400 yr ago (the age of our second-oldest Ma¯na¯ sample) was probably about 7 m shallower than it is today. Although less wave energy would be able to pass over the reef crest than can today, waves at least 6–9 m high would have been able to. Waves larger than that are common in the winter season at Ma¯na¯ today but are not likely to be compatible with the P. compressa–dominated branching coral framestone facies found there in the mid-Holocene. This facies change suggests an increase in wave energy\\n\\n### Ma¯na¯\\n\\nThe wave climate along the western coast of North America was found to be well correlated with the Southern Oscillation, with greatly increased wave activity during El Nin ˜ o events in the southern portion and during non–El Nin ˜ o years in the northern part (e.g., Seymour et al. 1984, Inman and Jenkins 1997, Seymour 1998, Allan and Komar 2000, Storlazzi and Griggs 2000). In Hawaiian waters, larger and more consistent northwest swells are observed between September and April of El Nin ˜ o years (Caldwell 1992). Corroborating this observation, Wang and Swail (2001) found that values of extreme seasonal substantial wave heights in the central North Pacific are strongly negatively correlated with winter season values of the Southern Oscillation Index and occur in association with a deeper and eastward-extended Aleutian Low. The Southern Oscillation Index, a commonly used measure of El\\n\\n### Influence of ENSO on Wave Climate\\n\\nfrom North Pacific swell and hurricanes in Hawaiian waters and that this effect gained magnitude in middle Holocene time and caused the end of reef accretion at some locations in Hawai‘i.\\n\\n|content|page number|\\n|---|---|\\n|Ma¯na¯|318|\\n---\\n## El Nin˜o Influence on Hawaiian Reefs - Rooney et al.\\n\\nNin˜o/Southern Oscillation intensity, has a stronger relationship with winter season negative values during El Nin˜o conditions extremes of substantial wave height than does and positive values during La Nin˜as (IRI/LDEO Climate Data Library 2002). The jet stream and storm tracks in the North Pacific also shift southward and closer to Hawai‘i, enhancing wave energy during the El Nin˜o phase of ENSO (e.g., Inman and Jenkins 1997).\\n\\nWe further investigated the relationship between ENSO and extremes of winter season substantial wave height in Hawaiian waters using the longest available (1981 to present) buoy record, from the National Data Buoy Center buoy no. 51001. Trade wind waves are filtered out and hourly buoy observations are reduced to monthly values by extracting the highest recorded significant wave heights. The latter step enables comparison with climatic indices, including the Southern Oscillation Index and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which are also recorded on a monthly basis.\\n\\nThe Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a climatic phenomenon with patterns similar to those of ENSO but more focused in higher latitudes and with each phase lasting two to three decades (Mantua et al. 1997).\\n\\nValues of the Southern Oscillation Index and Pacific Decadal Oscillation corresponding to the 60 highest monthly wave heights are compared with long-term mean values of the index for that specific month of the year. In other words, the Southern Oscillation Index value during a high wave event in January 1988 is compared with the mean of all January Southern Oscillation Index values (the monthly mean).\\n\\nIf the next highest wave event occurred in December 1998, that month’s Southern Oscillation Index value is compared with the mean of all December Southern Oscillation Index values. The large wave events are found to have a mean Southern Oscillation Index value that is more negative (more El Nin˜o–like) and is significant at the 80% level. Months with large wave events also have a mean Pacific Decadal Oscillation value that is higher (more El Nin˜o–like) than the overall mean of monthly means and is significant at the 95% level.\\n\\nIt appears reasonable to expect more reef-limiting North Pacific swell activity during El Nin˜o periods, but large wave events do occur during La Nin˜as. For example, the largest Nin˜o/Southern Oscillation intensity, has a stronger relationship with winter season negative values during El Nin˜o conditions extremes of substantial wave height than does and positive values during La Nin˜as (IRI/LDEO Climate Data Library 2002). The jet stream and storm tracks in the North Pacific also shift southward and closer to Hawai‘i, enhancing wave energy during the El Nin˜o phase of ENSO (e.g., Inman and Jenkins 1997).\\n\\nWe further investigated the relationship between ENSO and extremes of winter season substantial wave height in Hawaiian waters using the longest available (1981 to present) buoy record, from the National Data Buoy Center buoy no. 51001. Trade wind waves are filtered out and hourly buoy observations are reduced to monthly values by extracting the highest recorded significant wave heights. The latter step enables comparison with climatic indices, including the Southern Oscillation Index and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which are also recorded on a monthly basis.\\n\\nThe Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a climatic phenomenon with patterns similar to those of ENSO but more focused in higher latitudes and with each phase lasting two to three decades (Mantua et al. 1997).\\n\\nValues of the Southern Oscillation Index and Pacific Decadal Oscillation corresponding to the 60 highest monthly wave heights are compared with long-term mean values of the index for that specific month of the year. In other words, the Southern Oscillation Index value during a high wave event in January 1988 is compared with the mean of all January Southern Oscillation Index values (the monthly mean).\\n\\nIf the next highest wave event occurred in December 1998, that month’s Southern Oscillation Index value is compared with the mean of all December Southern Oscillation Index values. The large wave events are found to have a mean Southern Oscillation Index value that is more negative (more El Nin˜o–like) and is significant at the 80% level. Months with large wave events also have a mean Pacific Decadal Oscillation value that is higher (more El Nin˜o–like) than the overall mean of monthly means and is significant at the 95% level.\\n\\nIt appears reasonable to expect more reef-limiting North Pacific swell activity during El Nin˜o periods, but large wave events do occur during La Nin˜as.

April 2004\\n\\nNorth Pacific swell, 12.2 m (40 ft), from a record of visual observations of breaking wave height (P. Caldwell, unpubl. data) occurred on 4 December 1969, when the Southern Oscillation Index value indicates light to moderate La Nin ˜a conditions. However, not just the magnitude of major wave events, but also their frequency, is important in determining how much they will limit long-term reef accretion.\\n\\nAlthough the largest wave events may remove live and recently dead reef growth, if such events are rare enough a reef may be able to recover from the event and go on to accrete enough new material that there will be net accretion on the reef after the next major wave event. If, however, major events are more frequent, there may be insufficient time for recovery and enough new reef growth to accumulate before the next episode of large waves occurs, removing all material that accreted to the reef since the preceding event. We expect that an ENSO-induced change from rare to more common major wave events would be most obvious in areas that were already stressed by the initial more moderate wave climate but still able to produce net accretion. Only a modest increase in the frequency of major wave events in such areas might be all that was required to greatly reduce accretion or stop it altogether. Evidence supporting the feasibility of such a scenario is provided by Connell’s extensive (1997) study of disturbance and recovery of coral assemblages. Using quantitative records of coral abundance of at least 4 yr duration from 65 areas in the western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific, he found that the principal reason corals recovered in some areas but not others appears to be related to the type of disturbance. Coral cover was found to recover after 69% of the acute, short-term disturbances. However, recovery following chronic or long-term disturbances, including acute disturbances that occur so frequently that there is little time between them for recovery, only occurred 27% of the time. We speculate that an increase in the frequency and magnitude of major wave events related to the onset of modern ENSO conditions at the sites discussed here may have been sufficient to re- duce or preclude further accretion at those locations.\\n\\n## Holocene Changes in ENSO\\n\\nEvidence of a substantial reduction in reef accretion occurring at select locations in Hawai‘i ca. 5000 yr ago can be explained by an increase in wave energy, which is in turn hypothesized to reflect an increase in ENSO intensity. Results of a number of studies suggest that ENSO had substantially less effect on climate during early to mid-Holocene time. Investigating changes in vegetation patterns in Australia, New Zealand, and South America, McGlone et al. (1992) reported that interannual variability before ca. 5000 yr ago was substantially less, suggesting that modern ENSO-related climate patterns did not develop until about then. Based on a 15,000-yr sediment record from a lake in the Ecuadorian Andes, Rodbell et al. (1998) and Moy et al. (2002) confirmed that Holocene ENSO events were less frequent than currently until ca. 5000 yr ago.\\n\\nInvestigating metals from sediment layers in the anoxic Cariaco Basin at @10 N off the Venezuelan coast, Haug et al. (2001) found increased precipitation between ca. 10,500 and 5400 yr ago. They interpreted this signal as indicating a more northerly and consistent position of the intertropical convergence zone, suggesting that this was a period of weak ENSO and low ENSO variability.\\n\\nCoral records from the western Pacific are consistent with those studies, showing higher sea surface temperatures and reduced variability around 5400 and 6500 yr ago, suggestive of a substantially less vigorous ENSO (Gagan et al. 1998, Tudhope et al. 2001) and a strong ENSO signal by ca. 4200 yr ago (Corre`ge et al. 2000).\\n\\nVariations in Holocene ENSO intensity have been reproduced and investigated with numerical models as well. Using a coupled ocean-atmosphere global circulation model, Liu et al. (2000) simulated reduced ENSO intensity at 6000 and 11,000 yr ago, which they attributed to the effects of higher boreal summer insolation and stronger austral winter insolation. Clement et al. (2000) found\\n---\\n## El Nin˜o Influence on Hawaiian Reefs - Rooney et al. 321\\n\\nthat extreme warm El Nin˜o events were generation of reef accretion–limiting North smaller in amplitude and occurred less frequently in the mid-Holocene, based on results from a simple model of the tropical coupled ocean-atmosphere system. They argued that changes in the tropical Pacific are a response to orbitally driven changes in the seasonal cycle of solar radiation in the Tropics.\\n\\nEvidence for a reduced amplitude and frequency of ENSO events during early to mid-Holocene time, before 5000 yr ago, has been found in areas all around the tropical Pacific using a variety of approaches. Although the exact timing, nature, and causes of the change are still being actively debated, there appears to be wide agreement that it did occur. This is consistent with Holocene variations in reef accretion discussed here at several locations in the main Hawaiian Islands, which are suggestive of a shift in the wave regime. Although by no means conclusive, results of this study suggest that ENSO-related variations may be an important consideration in evaluating Quaternary reef accretion and paleoclimatology in Hawai‘i and other Pacific islands and warrant further investigation.\\n\\n## Impacts of Future Climate Change\\n\\nAn important area of active scientific research and debate involves the future of ENSO in a greenhouse-warmed Earth. Influences of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases were investigated by Timmermann et al. (1999) and Collins (2000) using different models. Both models generate reasonable simulations of ENSO dynamics consistent with observations during control runs, in contrast to earlier studies (e.g., Meehl et al. 1993, Knutson et al. 1997). Running them under enhanced greenhouse gas conditions, both models predict strengthening of the equatorial thermocline, resulting in an intensified ENSO signal, with higher amplitude and more frequent events. Those and earlier studies (e.g., Meehl et al. 1993, Knutson et al. 1997) show results that are somewhat different. However, the balance of evidence to date suggests that greenhouse forcing may enhance ENSO strength. If that happens, the equatorial thermocline, resulting in an intensified ENSO signal, with higher amplitude and more frequent events. Those and earlier studies (e.g., Meehl et al. 1993, Knutson et al. 1997) show results that are somewhat different. However, the balance of evidence to date suggests that greenhouse forcing may enhance ENSO strength. If that happens, the\\n\\nfrequency and intensity of El Nin˜o events are possibly going to increase in the coming decades due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. Taken as a whole, this suggests that the Hawaiian Archipelago will experience more hurricane and North Pacific swell events capable of removing reef material that accreted since the preceding event. This\\n---\\n## PACIFIC SCIENCE . April 2004\\n\\nadditional stress on already limited reef systems has implications for management of coral reef habitats. It suggests that the reduction of anthropogenic stresses, on top of the possibly increasing natural ones, is of increasing importance. Second, it reinforces the notion that management should be concentrated on relatively sheltered areas where anthropogenic influence is of comparable or greater magnitude than natural forces.\\n\\n### acknowledgments\\n\\nWe thank David Krupp and Floyd McCoy for logistical assistance and Patrick Caldwell of the NOAA Data Center Hawai‘i Liaison Office for North Pacific swell data and helpful discussions.

These \"hazards\" include: coastal erosion, sea-level rise, major storms, volcanic and seismic activity, tsunami inundation, coastal stream flooding, and extreme seasonal high wave events. In addition to these phenomena, coastal slope and local geologic setting are important factors for accurately determining the hazard potential for specific areas. To quantify the effects of individual hazards, their past magnitudes and occurrence have been evaluated from historical records and a semi-quantitative ranking scheme applied. The intensity of each hazard has been ranked low, moderate, or high using definitions based on their historical occurrence and magnitude. Comparison and statistical ranking and weighting of all hazard rankings for a given segment of coast, combined with geologic character and morphologic slope, are used to define the Overall Hazard Assessment which provides a guideline for management decisions regarding coastal land use and planning.\\n\\nKey Words: coastal hazards, hazard assessment, hazard mapping, Hawaiian Islands.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\n\"When the gales blow the sea is white-backed; when the sea rises, corals are washed ashore\" (Hawaiian Proverb; Pukui, 1983).\\n\\nThe ancient Hawaiians were well aware of the fury of nature and developed a respect for the hazards around them. The siting of villages and structures away from the coast on higher ground demonstrated their understanding of hazard potential and how to avoid severe consequences. In contrast, twentieth-century development emphasizes a rather complacent perception of a calm and tranquil paradise, commonly ignoring the fact that the Hawaiian Islands are subject to the adverse effects of a wide variety of natural coastal hazards.\\n\\nUDEL 2(X)1.

In the following sections, a discussion of each hazard is presented, including the assumptions, limitations, and variables that influenced ranking determinations. Prior to discussing the individual hazards, a brief discussion of the importance and use of the coastal geology and coastal zone slope is provided to demonstrate how the physical setting strongly influences coastal processes.\\n\\n### COASTAL SLOPE AND GEOLOGY\\n\\nCoastal slope determines the amount of coastal land exposed to extreme coastal processes. For example, along shorelines with cliffs, marine overwash from a hurricane is limited to a very narrow strip, whereas along low-lying coastal plains there may be significant inland incursion of marine water. The water-level elevation of overwash may be much higher on coasts with cliffs, due to steep offshore slopes and low wave energy dissipation, but the amount of land affected can be significantly less than on low-lying coasts.\\n\\n|Coastal Slope Zone|Description|\\n|---|---|\\n|Number 1|Gentle slope with a gradient less than or equal to 20%|\\n|Number 2|Moderate slope with a gradient greater than 20% and less than 45%|\\n|Number 3|Steep slope with a gradient greater than or equal to 45%|\\n\\nCoastal slope was subdivided into one of three values in the technical map series, with the darkest shade indicating the gentlest slope. Coastal slope zone rankings are made for the coastal plain in the elevation range of 0 to 60 ft above sea level.\\n\\n### COASTAL HAZARDS\\n\\nThe primary hazards affecting the Hawaiian coastal zone and the order in which they will be discussed are tsunami inundation, coastal stream flooding, seasonal high waves, high winds, and marine overwash associated with storms, erosion of the shore, sea-level rise, and volcanism and seismicity.\\n\\n#### Tsunami Inundation\\n\\nTsunamis pose a significant hazard in the Hawaiian coastal zone. According to Dudley and Lee (1998), Hawaii has experienced a total of 95 tsunamis in 185 years (1813-1998). Tsunamis are caused by the sudden movement of the sea floor in response to faulting, landsliding, or submarine volcanic eruptions or collapse of volcanic edifices.\\n---\\n## RICHMOND ET A L: HA WA COASTAL HAZARD S\\n\\nRICHMOND ET AL.

Hawaii has been struck by more tsunamis than any other region in the world (Dudley and Lee, 1998).\\n\\nCoastal Stream Flooding\\n\\nWatersheds in Hawaii are typically small, averaging <2.6 km2 (1 mi2; Peterson, 1996), and are characterized by steep slopes with little channel storage. Consequently, intense rainfall events often result in a rapid rise of water level and flash flooding. Coastal flooding of low-lying areas and rapid discharge of sediment into littoral environments are common effects of intense rains.\\n\\nThe geography of the shoreline plays an important role in the form of the tsunami wave. Tsunamis manifest predominantly as a rapidly rising sea level and less commonly as large breaking waves (bores). Tsunami waves may be very large in embayments, typically experiencing amplification in long tunnel-shaped bays. Fringing and barrier reefs appear to have a mitigating influence on tsunamis by dissipating wave energy. For example, within parts of Kaneohe Bay that are protected by a barrier reef, the 1946 tsunami reached only 0.6 m (2 ft) in height, while at neighboring Mokapu Head the wave crest exceeded 6 m (20 ft) (Loomis, 1976).\\n\\nFigure 2.

The Oahu Civil Defense Agency classifies high surf as a condition of very dangerous and damaging waves ranging in height from 3-6 m (10-20 ft) or more. These waves result from open-ocean swell generated by storms passing across the Pacific. High surf conditions on the northern shores of all islands are most common from October through March. The north shore of Oahu is world-renowned for its extremely large winter surf, attracting waveriders from around the globe. High surf on the southern shores occurs most commonly in the summer months when storms to the south, including southern hemisphere tropical cyclones, generate wave heights in the range of 1.2-4.5 m (4-15 ft). Tradewind generated waves, usually <2 m in height, occur throughout the year along all windward (east) coasts. The leeward (western) shores can receive wave energy from the north or south depending on local orientation and exposure. Infrequent, locally generated Kona storm waves can be large, up to 4.5 m (15 ft); they are associated with the passage of local fronts or extra-tropical low-pressure systems. Our knowledge of tropical cyclone behavior in the central Pacific has been greatly improved by satellite technology that allows us to track storms across the vast oceans. Shaw (1981) presented a comprehensive survey of documented tropical cyclones (of all intensities) over the period 1832-1979. Using written accounts of various observers, he identified 19 storms between 1832 and 1949 and 17 storms between 1950 and 1959. By 1960, satellite data became available. Thirty-four tropical cyclones were identified between 1960 and 1969, 34 between 1970 and 1979, and 54 storms between 1980 and 1989. Between 1970 and 1992, 106 tropical cyclones were identified in the central Pacific region resulting in an average of 4.5 storms per year (Schroeder, 1993). Of course not all of these storms intersected Hawaii (Figure 5), and actual hurricane strikes on the Hawaiian Islands are relatively rare historically. More commonly, \"near-misses\" that generate large swell and moderately high winds causing varying degrees of damage are the hallmark of hurricanes passing close to the islands. Impacts from these \"near-misses\" can be severe and lead to beach erosion, large waves, high winds, and marine overwash, despite the fact that the hurricane did not make landfall.

Indeed, the highest wind speeds recorded during Iwa were in windward Oahu where wind accelerated upon crossing and descending the steep cliffs of the Pali (Koolau Range). Storms directed on one side of an island may have significant impact on the other side. Because the last two hurricanes to hit the islands struck Kauai, there is a common misconception that Kauai lies in a more vulnerable position than the other islands. However, in a recent analysis of Hawaiian hurricanes, Schroeder (1993) concluded that every island has been affected by hurricanes and that no island is without risk. The poorly understood factors that control hurricane tracks play a key role in which islands are at highest risk during any given hurricane. Given minor changes in atmospheric conditions, Iniki could have just as easily come ashore at Oahu or missed the islands altogether. Tropical depressions and storms have intersected Hawaii on windward, northern, and southern coasts throughout history. In the summer of 1992, tropical storms (formerly hurricanes) Fernanda and Eugene passed along both the windward and leeward coasts of all islands within three weeks of each other, clearly demonstrating that either side of any island can sustain a direct hit by a shift in the large-scale atmospheric flow. Studies in the aftermath of Hurricane Iniki and Typhoon Russ on Guam showed the greatest threat related to hurricanes and typhoons is coastal overwash in the Pacific Islands with narrow insular shelves is due to water-level rise from wave forces rather than wind forces (Jaffe and Richmond, 1992; Fletcher et al., 1995). This differs from areas with wide shallow shelves, such as the east and gulf coasts of the United States, where wind set-up or storm surge is the primary type of elevated water levels. During Iniki, the strongest component of the overwash was the result of large waves causing extreme wave run-up and set-up. Other factors influencing coastal overwash are low atmospheric pressure (relatively minor factor), tidal stage, coastal topography, and location relative to the eye of the hurricane.\\n\\nCoastal Erosion\\n\\nCoastal erosion and beach loss are chronic and widespread problems in the Hawaiian Islands. Typical erosion rates in Hawaii are in the range of 15-30 cm/yr (0.5-1 ft/yr; Hwang, 1981; Sea Engineering, Inc., 1988; Makai Engineering, Inc. and Sea Engineering, Inc., 1991). Recent studies on Oahu have shown that nearly 24% or 27.5 km (17.1 mi) of an original 115 km (71.6 mi) of sandy shoreline (1940s) has been either significantly narrowed (17.2 km; 10.7 mi) or lost (10.3 km; 6.4 mi). Nearly one-quarter of the islands\\' beaches have been significantly degraded over the last half-century and all shorelines have been affected to some degree. Oahu shorelines are by far the most studied; however, Russ on Guam showed the greatest threat related to hurricanes and typhoons is coastal overwash in the Pacific Islands with narrow insular shelves is due to water-level rise from wave forces rather than wind forces (Jaffe and Richmond, 1992; Fletcher et al., 1995). This differs from areas with wide shallow shelves, such as the east and gulf coasts of the United States, where wind set-up or storm surge is the primary type of elevated water levels. During Iniki, the strongest component of the overwash was the result of large waves causing extreme wave run-up and set-up. Other factors influencing coastal overwash are low atmospheric pressure (relatively minor factor), tidal stage, coastal topography, and location relative to the eye of the hurricane.\\n---\\n|Beach Condition and Change|Mokuleia|Kaaawa|Kailua-Waimanalo|Maili-Makaha|Island-wide|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Originally sandy (km)|12.2 ± 1.0|7.5 ± 0.6|15.5 ± 1.3|6.0 ± 0.5|15.6 ± 9.8|\\n|Narrowed beach (km)|2.1 ± 0.2|3.2 ± 0.3|0.9 ± 0.1|1.3 ± 0.1|17.3 ± 1.5|\\n|Lost beach (km)|0.2 ± 0|0.8 ± 0.1|1.6 ± 0.1|0.2 ± 0|10.4 ± 0.9|\\n|Degraded beach (%)|18.7|53.6|16.3|24.9|23.9|\\n\\n|Nonarmored mean sandy beach width (m)|26.8|13.2|22.4|43.7|N.C.|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Armored mean sandy beach width (m)|12.8|8.9|7.1|24.5|N.C.|\\n\\nMean long-term shoreline change rate for armored sites (m/yr)\\n-0.2\\n-0.3\\n-0.6\\n-0.5\\nNC\\nRange of shoreline change rates for armored sites (m/yr)\\n-0.1 to -0.3\\n0.1 to -1.7\\n0.2 to -1.8\\n-0.2 to -1.0\\nNC\\n97.4 percent of armored beaches experienced chronic erosion prior to the period of narrowing. 92.1 percent of armored beaches experienced long-term (> 12 years) chronic erosion prior to narrowing. Island-wide, all armored beaches are on armored shorelines.\\n\\nN.C., not quantified\\n\\nBeach loss has been identified on the other islands as well. Causes of coastal erosion and beach loss in Hawaii are numerous but, unfortunately, are poorly understood and rarely quantified. Construction of shoreline hardening structures limits coastal land loss but does not alleviate beach loss and may actually accelerate the problem by prohibiting sediment deposition in front of the structures. Other factors contributing to beach loss include reduced sediment supply, large storms, and sea-level rise. Reduction in sand supply, either from landward or seaward (primarily reef) sources, can have a myriad of causes. Obvious causes such as beach sand mining and structures that prevent natural access to backbeach deposits remove sediment from the active littoral system. More complex issues of sediment supply can be related to reef health and carbonate production which, in turn, may be linked to changes in water quality. Second, the accumulated effect of large storms is to transport sediment beyond the littoral system. Third, rising sea level leads to a landward migration of the shoreline (see next section).\\n\\nIf sand is not available to the beach, such as when a wall is built to protect the land (e.g., sand is trapped behind the wall), then beach erosion will ensue as a result of sand impoundment, which leads to beach narrowing and eventually beach loss.\\n\\nMost beach sand in Hawaii is composed of bioclastic carbonate grains derived from the skeletons of corals, mollusks, algae, and other reef-dwelling, carbonate-producing organisms. Sand supplies are limited relative to mainland coasts where terrigenous sand derived from large rivers and other sources dominate. The formation of beachrock, storage of sand in coastal dunes, and irretrievable sand loss to deeper water beyond the reef crest all contribute to relatively low volumes of sand available to the system.\\n\\nOn many Hawaiian beaches, the available sand ends beyond the toe of the beach in a water depth of 1.2-1.8 m (4-6 ft) where the bottom becomes reef or a reef pavement. In contrast, on mainland beaches, the sand deposits often extend a considerable distance (hundreds to thousands of meters) offshore.\\n\\nTide gauges located on the islands of Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii record fluctuations in local sea level and analysis of these records provides rates of long-term (last several decades) sea-level variation around the state (Fletcher, 2000). Results show that each island has its own rate of relative sea-level rise.\\n---\\n## EN VTR ONMENTAL G EO S CTENC E\\n\\n|30|E N V I RON MEN TAL|G E 0 SCI ENe E S|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|22|Kauai| |\\n|Ninau|Nawilenii|Oahu|\\n|Niihau|Nawiliwili|Oahu|\\n|0.69±0.12m/decade| |Kincanc|\\n|0.69±0.12in/decade| |Molokai|\\n| | |Honolulu|\\n|0.02±0.03in/decade| |Kahului|\\n|0.62±0.03in/decade| |Lanai|\\n|0.97±0.09in/decade| |Maui|\\n\\n## Variation of sea-level rise in the main Hawaiian islands based on tide gauge records (after Hwang and Fletcher, 1992)\\n\\n|Kahoolave|\\n|---|\\n|Kahoolawe|\\n|Kahului|\\n|Lanai|\\n|Maui|\\n|Hilo|1.55±0.09in/decade|\\n\\nFigure 6 shows the relative sea-level rise due to the local isostatic response. Hawaii, because of the heavy load of geologically young volcanic material, is flexing the underlying crust causing the island to subside, creating a comparatively rapid rate of relative sea-level rise on the order of 3.9 mm/yr (1.5 in/decade). Maui is also affected by this process and is experiencing rapid sea-level rise, nearly 2.54 mm/yr (1 in/decade). Oahu and Kauai, on the other hand, lie outside the area of subsidence and have lesser rates of relative sea-level rise, about 1.5 mm/yr (0.6 in/decade).\\n\\n## Seismicity and Volcanism\\n\\nThe Hawaiian Islands are located in a more complex and hazardous seismic setting than generally realized. Volcanism is the source of energy for about 95% of the earthquakes on the island of Hawaii. The Island of Hawaii experiences thousands of earthquakes each year, with most being small and unnoticed. However, minor damage resulting from stronger shocks is not infrequent.\\n\\nAccording to Heliker (1997), the Island of Hawaii is the most seismically active place in the United States. Most seismicity on the Big Island is related to the movement of magma within Kilauea or Mauna Loa volcanoes. Strong earthquakes of magnitude 5 or higher can cause property damage and endanger people.\\n\\nThe prospect for continued beach degradation and coastal land loss is strongly dependent upon continued sea-level rise. There is no evidence or theory suggesting that this trend will do anything other than continue through the near future. Despite uncertainties in predicting future sea levels, the present rate of rise is sufficiently rapid to cause coastal retreat at significant rates.\\n\\nA more complete discussion of future sea levels and impacts is available in Fletcher (1992). The commonly used \"Bruun Rule\" method of relating sea-level rise to beach retreat predicts a retreat of 1.2-1.5 m (4-5 ft) per decade on Oahu and Kauai.\\n---\\n## RIC HMON D L [ AL:: HA WATI CO A STAL HA ZA R D $\\n\\n|Kaual|Kauai|\\n|---|---|\\n|Niihau|Eaul|\\n|Entccniats Epicenters 01 the Illlger earthquakes| |\\n\\n## FIGURE\\n\\nMap depicting vokunic und scismic hazans of pe main Hawaiian Eslank /ufter Funumoto dal _\\nMap depicting \\\\\\'olc:mic and seismic hazards of pe main Hawaiian Islands (after Furumoto ct al.. 1990 and Hclikcr. 1997).\\n\\nHawaiian history. Both tremors caused extensive damage to both wooden and stone houses and each generated locally destructive tsunamis.\\n\\nFurumolo & a. ( 1990) analyzed the record of Big Island seismicity and found that earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater tend to occur in clusters with recurrence intervals of 10-12 years. Wyss and Koyanagi (1988) identified two regions, the East Kona Block and the South Kona Block, as not having seismically ruptured in the last 100 years.\\n\\nIn the Central Region, defined by Furumoto et al. (1990) as the area encompassing Maui and Oahu, the seismicity is generally related to tectonic activity on the seafloor near the Hawaiian Islands, although the potential for volcanic-related seismicity on Maui\\'s Haleakala Volcano is considered significant. The region has experienced three damaging earthquakes within historical times. Tectonic activity capable of generating hazardous earthquakes in the Central Region is related to seafloor fractures and faults around the islands.\\n\\nThe largest of these, the Molokai Seismic Zone and the Diamond Head Fault have been the locus for a number of earthquakes of 4.0 magnitude or higher (Furumolo et aI., 1990).\\n---\\n## ENVIRONMENTAL GEO SCIENCE\\n\\nThe northwestern or Kauai-Niihau region has experienced tremors from earthquakes originating farther south, but no known seismic activity has originated among these northern islands. The earthquake risk for the northwestern islands has been evaluated as minimal.\\n\\nVolcanic hazards are, of course, greatest on the southern shore of Hawaii, but active seismicity on Haleakala and on Mauna Loa indicate that these volcanoes should continue to be perceived as potentially hazardous. The USGS has completed an extensive mapping program to determine the history and severity of the volcanic hazard on the Island of Hawaii (Wolfe and Morris, 1996).\\n\\nHawaiian volcanoes erupt either at their summits where lava collects, and may overflow from calderas, or along their flanks where lava issues through zones of weakness in the volcano, called rift zones. The volcanic hazard is associated with lava flows, explosive eruptions, airborne lava fragments, poisonous and corrosive volcanic gases, and ground cracks and settling.\\n\\nLava flows present the most frequent hazard associated with Hawaiian volcanoes; however, they rarely endanger human life. Property loss and economic devastation are the most frequent consequence of lava movement. Airborne ash, cinders, and other lava fragments are usually only hazardous in the immediate vicinity of an eruption. Volcanic gases generated by the present eruptions at Kilauea are composed mostly of water vapor, with lesser amounts of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\\n\\nExplosive eruptions are not common at Kilauea, but they have occurred within historical times. The interaction of groundwater and hot magma is the usual mechanism leading to an explosion, and the resulting magnitude of the event can be catastrophic in certain circumstances. In 1790, turbulent avalanches of hot gases and rock fragments created pyroclastic surges that flowed several miles to the southwest from the summit of Kilauea.\\n\\nGeologists have analyzed thick deposits from pyroclastic flows around both Mauna Loa and Kilauea and determined that large surges have occurred in the recent past.\\n\\n## HAZARD RANKING AND INTENSITY\\n\\nRanking hazard intensity in a region requires applying scientific judgment grounded in a thorough understanding.\\n\\nHazard intensity rankings for each process are summarized in Table 4 and following is a brief description of how each intensity ranking was developed.\\n---\\n|Threat|Low (1)|Moderately Low (2)|Moderately High (3)|High (4)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Tsunami inundation|No history of tsunami activity and no flooding|History of minor tsunami flooding|History of major flooding|History of major flooding|\\n|Coastal stream flooding|No history of coastal stream flooding|History of non-damaging flooding|Abundance of streams and high seasonal rainfall|Historically high flood damage on gentle slope|\\n|High waves|No reasonable basis to expect high waves|Seasonal high waves 4-6 ft|Seasonal high waves 6-8 ft with hazardous run-up and currents|Seasonal high waves >12 ft, characterized by rapid onset|\\n|Storm overwash and/or high winds|No history of overwash or high winds|Minor historical overwash (>10 ft) and/or high winds (40 mph gust)|Historical overwash >10 ft on steep slope and/or high winds with localized structural damage (75 mph gust)|Historical overwash >10 ft on moderate to gentle slope and/or high winds with widespread structural damage (75 mph gust)|\\n|Coastal erosion|Long-term accretion (>10 yr) with no history of erosion|Long-term stable, or minor erosion/accretion cycles|Long-term erosion rate >1 ft/yr; or highly dynamic erosion/accretion cycles with significant lateral shifts in the shoreline|Chronic long-term erosion >1 ft/yr, or beach is lost, seawall at waterline|\\n|Sea-level rise (0.04 in. = 1 mm)|Steep coastal slope where rise >0.04 in./yr or gentle slope where rise <0.04 in./yr|Gentle or moderate slope where rise >0.04 in./yr|Gentle or moderate slope where rise >0.08 in./yr|Gentle or moderate slope where rise >0.12 in./yr|\\n|Volcanism and/or seismicity|No history of volcanic or seismic activity|No volcanic activity in historic times; seismic probability zone 1, minor historic seismic damage|Limited history of volcanism; seismic probability zones 2 or 3 recommended|Frequent volcanism, seismic probability zones 2 or 3 recommended|\\n---\\n### ENVIRONMENTAL GEO SCIENCE S\\n\\nof mitigation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or the Inc., 1991; Coyne, et al., 1996, 1999; Fletcher et al., 1997).

The highest intensity ranking is applied to low-lying streams with high rainfall watersheds (seasonal monthly maximum >200 mm; 7.9 in.) where a historically high level of flooding has occurred and where mitigation improvements have been attempted since the most recent damaging flood. Lower rankings are based on flood history, watershed climatology, and mitigation levels.\\n\\nIn areas lacking historical studies, environmental indicators of shoreline erosion, such as the presence of beachrock, sea walls, and/or revetments, and narrow beaches in front of vegetation lines that have been abraded or clearly subject to wave wash, were used to assign rankings. The highest erosion category (4) is defined as long-term erosion at a rate exceeding 0.3 m/yr (1 ft/yr) or a seawall or revetment without a beach where one was formerly located. Seawalls, which are popularly described as \"stabilizing\" a shoreline, may actively contribute to beach erosion where sand supply is limited and there is a net landward movement of the shoreline.\\n\\n|Environmental Indicator|Ranking|\\n|---|---|\\n|Seasonal high surf|4|\\n|Wave hazard|3 or 4|\\n|Storm overwash and high wind|Based on wind speed and historical structural damage|\\n|Volcanism and seismicity|High hazard intensity for areas with frequent volcanism and historical seismic activity|\\n\\nSea-level rise has not been evaluated here as a dynamic or energetic hazard. It is, however, an agent in exacerbating, rather than mitigating, each of the other hazardous processes. Where the rate of sea-level rise is high (>3 mm/yr; 0.12 in/yr) and the coastal zone slope is low, sea-level rise is ranked at high intensity. Moderate rates of rise on steeper slopes define less intense ranking levels.\\n\\nStorm overwash and high wind ranking indices are based on levels of windspeed, historical structural damage, and overwash elevation. In the absence of meteorological data or process to the contrary, it is assumed that all Hawaiian coasts are equally vulnerable to hurricane impacts and that the only mitigating variables are local in nature (e.g., slope, elevation, geology, and offshore barriers).\\n\\nHistorical erosion rates for Hawaiian sandy shorelines have been derived primarily from aerial photograph interpretation (Hwang, 1981; Makai Engineering, Inc. and Sea Engineering).\\n\\n### OVERALL HAZARD ASSESSMENT\\n\\nIn addition to ranking individual hazards, a nominal overall hazard assessment (OHA) for the coast was calculated.\\n---\\n## RIC HMOND ET AL.: HAWAII COASTAL HAZARDS\\n\\nCombining individual assessments and applying aerial slope failure and shoreline collapse need to be more weighted to emphasize dynamic hazards.

The damage history related to all hazards only covers the late nineteenth to twentieth centuries. Damage in areas hit by natural hazards during early years (prior to 1960) was only recorded for then populated regions; thus, a significant (and unknown) hazard history may exist for areas that were more recently populated. Every hazardous phenomenon described here, and others such as sub- coastal stream flooding, seasonal high waves, marine overwash, high winds, and tsunami inundation, may achieve a high level of severity in a relatively short time. The hazards of long-term sea-level rise and beach erosion do not constitute a life-threatening hazard, although they certainly may exacerbate other hazards.\\n\\n### TABLE 5: Values used to determine the OHA\\n\\n|Value|OHA|\\n|---|---|\\n|2-4|Very low hazard|\\n|4-8|Low hazard|\\n|8-12|Moderate to low hazard|\\n|12-16|Moderate hazard|\\n|16-20|Moderate to high hazard|\\n|20-24|High hazard|\\n|24-28|Very high hazard|\\n---\\n## ENVIRONMENTAL GEOSCIENCE\\n\\n|36|ENVIRONMENTAL GEOSCIENCE|\\n|---|---|\\n|Floods and flood control, unpublished report.

Romine and Charles H. Fletcher|4|\\n\\nAbstract Coastal armoring (defined as any structure designed to prevent shoreline retreat that interacts with wave run-up at some point of the year) has, historically, been a typical response to managing the problem of beach erosion on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. By limiting the ability of an eroding shoreline to migrate landward, coastal armoring on Oahu has contributed to narrowing and complete loss of many kilometers of beach. In this paper, changes in beach width are analyzed along all armored and unarmored beaches on the island using historical shoreline positions mapped from orthorectified aerial photographs from as early as the late 1920s. Over the period of study, average beach width decreased by 11% 4% and nearly all (95%) documented beach loss was fronting armored coasts. Among armored beach sections, 72% of beaches are degraded, which includes 43% narrowed (28% significantly) and 29% (8.6 km) completely lost to erosion. Beaches fronting coastal armoring narrowed by 36% 5% or 0.10 0.03 m/year, on average. In comparison, beach widths along unarmored coasts were relatively stable with slightly more than half (53%) of beaches experiencing any form of degradation. East and south Oahu have the highest proportion of armored coast (35% and 39%, respectively) and experienced the greatest percent of complete beach loss (14% and 12%, respectively). West and north coasts, with relatively little armoring (10% and 12% armored, respectively), experienced little complete beach loss (2% and 6%, respectively). However, beaches are still significantly narrowed compared to historical patterns on west and north coasts (61% and 70%, respectively). We find at these sites that cultivation of coastal vegetation may be a factor in beach narrowing on Oahu, along with beach erosion. Increased \\'flanking\\' erosion (accelerated\\n\\nB.M.

Since a strand plain of unconsolidated carbonate sand backs large segments of the Hawaii shoreline (Sherrod et al. 2007; Fletcher et al. 2011), one may assume there is adequate sediment on the backshore for an eroding beach migrating landward to develop a profile in equilibrium with nearshore conditions and underlying geology. However, on many Hawaii beaches, the response to beach erosion has been to armor the backshore to protect coastal properties, and thus impound this sand resource (Hwang 1981; Sea Engineering Inc 1988; Fletcher et al. 1997; Fletcher 1992; Makai Ocean Engineering and Sea Engineering 1991). In such cases, the water line continues to migrate landward while the backshore remains fixed – resulting in narrowing and eventually complete loss of the beach. Sediment that would otherwise be available to the littoral system is impounded behind seawalls, revetments, sand bags, and other designs; thereby depriving adjacent beaches and leading to a trend of increased erosion within the littoral cell. The narrowing effects of armoring on beach width are also documented in studies from other regions (e.g., Carter et al. 1986; Hall and Pilkey 1991; Komar and McDougal 1988; Kraus and McDougal 1996; McDonald and Patterson 1984; Tait and Griggs 1990).\\n\\n\\'Healthy\\' Hawaii beaches are important to the local lifestyle and a vital attraction for the tourism-based economy. Fletcher et al. (1997) found that coastal armoring led to narrowing or complete loss along ~24% of beaches on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\\n\\nSeawalls and other armoring styles are often attributed with causing coastal erosion, yet in Hawaii we find that shoreline armoring is typically a response to pre-existing coastal erosion. Because of this, it is appropriate to ask two sets of questions. One, does armoring accelerate pre-existing erosion and does it initiate and or accelerate erosion on adjacent properties? Two, does armoring lead to other negative impacts such as beach loss or beach narrowing, which, although caused by erosion, we define as separate from erosion? Here, we primarily explore the latter through analysis of beach narrowing fronting coastal armoring. Evidence is also provided for \\'flanking\\' erosion on beaches adjacent to coastal armoring.\\n\\n10.2 Physical Setting\\n\\nThe Hawaiian Islands are comprised of eight high volcanic islands in the upper tropics of the north Pacific. Oahu, located between 21 and 22 north latitude, is the most populated of the main islands. The island is fringed by a Pleistocene\\n---\\n## Armoring on Eroding Coasts Leads to Beach Narrowing\\n\\n|1530w|158*10\"|1530\\'|157 =0|157*40\\'|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Kaena|North|Kahuku Pt| |East|\\n|West|Oahu|Honolulu|Kaneohe Bay|Hakapuu|\\n|Darbers Pt| | |Walkki| |\\n|10km South|10km South|10km South|10km South|10km South|\\n\\nFig. 10.1 Four regions of Oahu reef platform cut by relict erosional features (e.g., channels, karst depressions) 66 formed during periods of lower sea level (Fletcher et al. 2008). Hawaiian beaches 67 are comprised primarily of calcareous sands. This sediment originated on the 68 fringing reef platform through either direct organic precipitation in the reef ecosystem or through bioerosion of skeletal limestone. Sands may be stored in offshore 70 channels and depressions, on low-lying coastal plains stranded by late-Holocene 71 sea level fall (Fletcher and Jones 1996), or in the modern beach and dune system 72 (Harney et al. 2000; Harney and Fletcher 2003). Hawaii beaches, like most carbonate beaches, are typically narrower than continental beaches due to limited sediment supply. 75\\n\\nLocated in the middle of the Pacific in a microtidal zone, wave energy is the 76 predominant driver of shoreline processes in Hawaii. Large waves from North 77 Pacific storms are common in winter months, typically affecting north and west - 78 exposed shores. South-exposed shorelines are affected by smaller long-period swell 79 from southern oceans in summer. Easterly trade winds and the waves they produce 80 are common on leeward shores year-round but most frequent in summer months 81 (Vitousek and Fletcher 2008).\\n\\nThe island is divided into four regions for analysis: east, south, west, and north 83 (Fig. 10.1). East Oahu, from Kahuku Point in the north to Makapuu Point in the 84 south, is moderately developed with single-family homes and a coastal highway 85 lining most beaches. The east Oahu shoreline faces directly into the predominant 86 easterly trade winds and is occasionally affected by large refracted northerly swells 87\\n---\\nB.M. Romine and C.H. Fletcher\\n\\n88 in winter. Beaches in the northeast (north of Kaneohe Bay) are typically narrow\\n\\nand fringed by a wide (~0.5 km), shallow reef platform. Many homes and the coastal\\n\\nhighway were constructed too close to eroding beaches in the past century resulting\\n\\nin extensive coastal armoring along northeast shores. Beaches in the southeast (south\\n\\nof Kaneohe Bay) are wider, relative to the northeast, with a deeper fringing reef.\\n\\nSouth Oahu, from Makapuu Point in the east to Barbers Point in the west, is the\\n\\nmost densely populated and urbanized region of Oahu and includes the highly\\n\\nengineered shores of Honolulu and Waikiki. The south shore is fringed by a wide\\n\\nshallow reef and is affected by southerly swells in summer and refracted tradewind\\n\\nwaves year-round.\\n\\nWest Oahu, from Barbers Point in the south to Kaena Point in the north, is the\\n\\nleast developed of the four island regions. Single-family homes, beach parks, and\\n\\nundeveloped property line most beaches. Western, leeward shores receive refracted\\n\\nnortherly waves in winter and refracted southerly waves in summer – leading to\\n\\nlarge seasonal changes in alongshore transport and beach width.\\n\\nDevelopment along north Oahu, between Kaena Point in the west and Kahuku\\n\\nPoint in the east, is similar to east Oahu with single-family homes lining most\\n\\nbeaches. Northern shores are impacted by large northerly waves in winter causing\\n\\ntemporary seasonal erosion on many beaches. Relatively small, refracted tradewind\\n\\nwaves are typical in summer.\\n\\n## 10.3 Data and Methods\\n\\nFor our analysis, we use historical shoreline positions mapped from high-resolution\\n\\n(0.5 m pixel) orthorectified aerial photo mosaics following Fletcher et al. (2003, 2011),\\n\\nand Romine et al. (2009). Two shoreline proxies are utilized for beach width analysis:\\n\\nthe Low Water Mark (LWM) and the vegetation line. The LWM or beach toe is the\\n\\nbase of the foreshore and marks the seaward edge of the subaerial beach. The\\n\\nvegetation line marks the landward edge of the beach and is located at the seaward\\n\\nextent of interannual vegetation growth (vegetation that survives annual high run-up\\n\\nof waves) or at the base of armoring structures (e.g., sea wall). Beach width is defined\\n\\nas the distance between the LWM and vegetation line (or armoring) (Fig. 10.2).\\n\\nWe use survey-quality vertical aerial photographs with sufficient spatial resolution\\n\\n(<0.5 m) and tonal contrast to identify shoreline features. New imagery was acquired\\n\\nfor the Oahu shoreline in 2005–2008 including synchronous position and orientation\\n\\n(POS) navigation data from an on-board aircraft global positioning system and inertial\\n\\nand mobilization unit (IMU). The POS data is used with a high-resolution digital\\n\\nelevation model (DEM; 5 m horizontal, sub-meter vertical) to rectify and mosaic\\n\\nthe imagery. Typically, one historical air photo set meeting minimum quality\\n\\nstandards is available for each decade going back to the late 1920s or late 1940s.\\n\\nHistorical air photos are orthorectified and mosaicked using ground control points\\n\\ncollected from more recent ortho imagery. The orthorectification process typically\\n\\nproduces mosaics with root mean square (RMS) positional errors <2 m.\\n---\\nArmoring on Eroding Coasts Leads to Beach Narrowing\\n\\n|Vegetation line|\\n|---|\\n|Seawall|\\n|Berm|\\n|Swash = Sea level|\\n|Measured beach width|Zong|Toe (low water mark)|\\n\\nFig. 10.2 Beach width is the distance between the beach toe (low water mark) and vegetation line (or armoring) (Modified from Fletcher et al. (1997))\\n\\nDue to limited availability of historical air photos, we attempt to locate and utilize all available imagery. We do not remove historical shorelines from a time series based on records of large storms or waves. Rather, we account for fluctuations in shoreline position due to waves and storms in our uncertainty analysis (see: Uncertainties). However, historical shorelines may be removed from the time series in special cases. Some Oahu beaches have been artificially altered to the extent that the physics of the beach system have been permanently changed. Examples include removal of beach sand by mining operations, artificial beach fills, and construction of coastal engineering structures such as groins or seawalls. In these cases, shorelines prior to such alterations are removed from the time series and beach changes are analyzed only for the recent configuration of the beach. LWM and vegetation line positions are measured at regularly-spaced (roughly 20 m) shore-normal transects cast from an arbitrary offshore baseline.\\n\\nFor this study we define coastal armoring as any structure coming in contact with wave run-up and thereby interfering with natural coastal processes at any point of the year. Typically, these are designed to prevent coastal recession and retain sand. This includes rubble or stone revetments (with or without mortar); cement, brick, or stone walls; and wood or metal bulkheads. We also include landscaping or retaining walls that have transitioned into shoreline armoring on receding coasts. Armoring structures typically have little or no intra-annual vegetation growth (e.g., tall shrubs or trees) on the seaward side indicating the wall is impacted by wave run-up.\\n\\nCoastal armoring is mapped using the most-recent (2005–2008) orthophoto mosaics. Locations are verified with high-resolution (~10 cm resolution) original air photo images and site visits. For this study we map only shore-parallel armoring structures on beaches or former locations of beach (i.e., where the beach was lost in the time span of analysis). Armoring on rocky shoreline or along engineered shorelines that never had beach in the time span of this study are not included in this study.\\n---\\n## B.M. Romine and C.H. Fletcher\\n\\nBeach Width Uncertainties\\n\\nLWM shoreline positions are highly variable due to tides, storms, and waves resulting in positional uncertainties with shorelines mapped from aerial photographs. Additional uncertainties for LWMs and vegetation lines also arise from the mapping process including RMS error of the orthorectification process and on-screen identification and digitization of shoreline features. Following Fletcher et al. (2003), Romine et al. (2009), and Fletcher et al. (2011), five positional errors are calculated for LWMs: rectification error (Er, RMS error of ortho process), digitization error (Ed, identification and digitization of LWM), pixel error (Ep, spatial resolution), tidal fluctuation error (Etd, horizontal shifts due to tides) and seasonal error (Es, waves and tides); combined as a root sum of squares to arrive at a total positional error, Etp. In similar fashion, the total positional error of a vegetation line (Eveg) is the root sum of squares of Er, Ep, and digitization error for vegetation lines (Evid, estimated at 2 m). The vegetation line is assumed to mark the annual high wash of waves and is, therefore, not prone to shorter-term (intra-annual) fluctuations. Thus, Es and Etd are not included when calculating positional uncertainties for vegetation lines.\\n\\nBeach width is the difference between vegetation line distance and LWM distance along a transect. However, calculating the uncertainty of the beach width as the root sum of squares of Etp and Eveg overestimates the error. We may omit the rectification errors (Er) for both the LWM and vegetation line because we are no longer concerned with geographic position; only the net distance between the vegetation line and LWM. Any errors due to rectification between the shoreline features are assumed to be negligible at those distances (&lt;100 m). Therefore, a more accurate estimate of the beach width error, Evt, is:\\n\\n(Ed^2 + 2Ep^2 + Etd^2 + Es^2 + Evid^2)^0.5\\n\\n## Calculating Beach Width Changes\\n\\nBeach width change rates and net beach width change are calculated at each transect using weighted least squares (WLS) linear regression to fit a trend line to the time series of measured beach widths. Beach width uncertainties are applied as weights (1/Evt^2). Thus, beach widths with higher uncertainty values have less influence on the trend line. This method is similar to recent studies (Romine et al. 2009; Hapke et al. 2010; Fletcher et al. 2011) – only, beach width data is used instead of shoreline positions. The annual rate of beach width change (m/year) is the slope of the trend line (Fig. 10.3). The net change in beach width is the difference between the estimated beach width values at the end points of the WLS trend line (at the earliest and most recent shoreline times). Uncertainties of estimated\\n---\\n## Armoring on Eroding Coasts Leads to Beach Narrowing\\n\\n|Fig. 10.3 Calculating beach width change with weighted least squares (WLS)|\\n|---|\\n|Beach Width Trend|\\n|abw|bwi-|bwt|\\n|bw rate|slope (m/yr)|predicted onu beach width (bw)|predicted final beach width (bw)|\\n|1920|1940|1960|1980|2000|\\n|beach widths from the regression line are calculated at 1-sigma (standard deviation) to be consistent with 1-sigma positional uncertainties calculated for measured|\\n|beach widths.

Here we provide analysis on a\\n244 regional scale and present several case studies documenting pe effects of coastal\\n245 armoring on Oahu beaches.\\n246 10.5.1 East Oahu\\n247 Of pe four island regions, pe relatively narrow (average ~ 18 m) beaches of east\\n248 Oahu suffered pe most damage from beach erosion and coastal armoring\\n249 (Fig. 10.4). Roughly 35% or 14.7 km of east Oahu beaches are armored. The\\n250 average beach widp fronting coastal armoring decreased from 15.3 1.1 m to\\n251 8.7 1.0 m ( 43% 10%), suggesting pat many of pe remaining narrowed\\n252 beaches fronting armoring likely become unusable at high tide. Nearly 6 km or 14%\\n253 of east Oahu beaches were completely lost to erosion; nearly all of it (98%) fronting\\n254 coastal armoring. Seventy-four percent of armored beaches on pe east side are\\n255 degraded including 38% lost and 36% narrowed (20% significantly). Forty-five\\n256 percent of east Oahu beaches widened (18% significantly), of which 80% occurred\\n257 on unarmored coasts.\\n258 While erosion and narrowing is a problem on many east Oahu beaches, pe\\n259 region also has some of pe longest extents of accreting beaches in Hawaii (Fletcher\\n260 et al. 2011) As a result, widps of east Oahu beaches remained approximately stable,\\n261 as a whole, wip an average change of 5% 7%. Beach widps on unarmored\\n262 beaches on east Oahu increased by 9% 6% or roughly 2 m. However, it is\\n263 interesting to note pat Kailua Beach, which is accreting along most of its lengp,\\n264 actually narrowed as seaward growp of vegetation outpaced pe prograding beach.\\n265 The highest proportion of armoring, narrowing, and beach loss on any segment\\n266 of pe Oahu shoreline is found between Laie and Kaaawa on pe norpeast coast.\\n267 Flanking erosion norp of armoring at Makalii Point has resulted in shoreline\\n268 recession of over 40 m since 1967, loss of beachfront property, and is preatening\\n269 to undermine beach front homes (Figs. 10.5 and 10.6).\\n---\\n# Armoring on Eroding Coasts Leads to Beach Narrowing\\n\\nFig. 10.4 East Oahu beach\\n---\\nB.M.

Shoreline change rates calculated for the beach immediately north of armoring installed by 1967 show statistically significant increases in erosion rates (at the 95% confidence interval) when comparing rates from 1928 to 1967 and 1967 to 2005. As an example, directly adjacent to the armoring (within Fig. 10.6 photo) the rate changed from 0.5 + 0.4 m/year (accretion) to 1.0 + 0.5 m/year (erosion) following installation of armoring. Erosion also increased fronting the northern half of the 1967 armoring, though not to the degree measured on the flanking unarmored beach. Low rubble revetments were recently (2000s) installed to protect homes on the north side of the point.\\n---\\nArmoring on Eroding Coasts Leads to Beach Narrowing...\\n\\n|South Lanikai, 1988|1996|\\n|---|---|\\n|1938 beach|1996 beach|\\n|South Lanikai, 1996|2005|\\n|1998 beach|Zuuy beach|\\n|1988 armoring| |\\n|Zuuy armoring| |\\n|Fig. 10.7 Beach loss and flanking erosion at south Lanikai (1988–2005, location shown in Fig. 10.4)| |\\n\\nAt south Lanikai beach a trend of accretion reversed in the late 1970s. In the late 1980s, in response to the erosion, seawalls were constructed along much of the southern end of the beach to protect coastal properties (Fig. 10.7). By the mid-1990s the beach at the southern end of Lanikai had been completely lost to erosion and armoring proliferated to the north ~ 150 m in response to the northward-moving beach loss. By 2005 the beach had completely disappeared along the southern half of Lanikai. Recent beach surveys at south Lanikai indicate that flanking erosion continues to move north. Comparisons of shoreline change rates at south Lanikai indicate that accelerated erosion due to the flanking process followed installation of the first armoring in the 1980s. Shoreline change rates are compared for the periods 1975–1988 (from the beginning of the erosion trend at south Lanikai to the first installation of coastal armoring) and 1988–2005 (after the first installation of coastal armoring). Rates along roughly 700 m of the beach flanking the north end of the armoring became more erosional and in most cases switched from accretion to erosion following installation of the armoring. However, none of the rate changes are statistically significant due largely to the limited number of historical shorelines available for the two measurement periods (three shorelines, each).\\n\\nSouth Oahu\\n\\nAlong south Oahu (Fig. 10.8), analysis of beach width changes and its relation to shore-parallel coastal armoring is complicated by extensive use of other types of coastal engineering including groins, breakwalls, dredging, and fill – especially along beaches of Hawaii Kai to Kahala and Waikiki. As mentioned previously, beach changes are calculated for the modern configuration of the shoreline following major engineering efforts. Thirty-nine percent (10.2 km) of beaches along south Oahu are armored; the highest percent of the four Oahu regions. Looking at south Oahu beaches as a\\n---\\nB.M. Romine and C.H.

Twelve percent (3.1 km) of south Oahu beaches were completely lost to| | |309|\\n|erosion. Average beach width along south Oahu decreased by 10% 4% or| | |310|\\n|1.8 0.7 m.| | |311|\\n|Comparing armored and unarmored beaches we find that the majority (67%)| | |312|\\n|of armored beaches along south Oahu are degraded with 40% narrowed (27%| | |313|\\n|significantly) and 27% lost, while the majority, or 61%, of unarmored beaches| | |314|\\n|have widened over the period (29% significantly). Beach width decreased by| | |315|\\n|32% 5% (6.9 1.1 m) on armored beaches and beach widths increased by| | |316|\\n|9% 5% (1.5 0.9 m) on unarmored beaches.| | |317|\\n|Areas of significant narrowing fronting coastal armoring include the Kahala| | |318|\\n|shoreline where the beach has been completely lost to erosion. Beach width| | |319|\\n|changes for the rest of Maunalua Bay (Hawaii Kai – Kahala) and Waikiki are| | |320|\\n|highly variable alongshore. This is likely related to numerous groins and other| | |321|\\n|shore-perpendicular structures that interrupt alongshore sediment transport leading| | |322|\\n|to updrift impoundment and downdrift erosion. Nearly the entire length of the| | |323|\\n|Waikiki and Ala Moana shoreline is armored. The greatest extent of beach loss in| | |324|\\n|this section is at the eastern end of Waikiki adjacent to Diamond Head.| | |325|\\n|At the west end of Kahala Beach, roughly 900 m of beach was completely lost to| | |326|\\n|erosion fronting coastal armoring (Fig. 10.9). Historical changes in the extent of| | |327|\\n|armoring along west Kahala are difficult to discern from air photos due to dense| | |328|\\n|cultivated vegetation along seaward property lines. It appears that most or all of the| | |329|\\n|armoring was constructed prior to 1975 with extensions along a few adjacent| | |330|\\n|properties in recent years in response to flanking erosion (Fig. 10.10). Analysis of| | |331|\\n|changes in erosion rates on flanking beaches is not provided for this region due| | |332|\\n|to the difficulty in mapping armored locations from historical air photos and limited| | |333|\\n|shoreline data following the installation of armoring.| | |334|\\n\\n### West Oahu\\n\\nThe west Oahu coast (Fig. 10.11) is the least armored of the four Oahu regions with armoring along only 1.2 km or 10% of beaches. However, the beaches are highly\\n---\\nFig. 10.10 Flanking erosion and temporary armoring (sand bags), west Kahala Beach (location shown in Fig. 10.9; photo date, March 21, 2011)\\n\\n338 erosional (Fletcher et al. 2011) and coastal armoring has contributed to beach narrowing. As a whole, 61% of west Oahu beaches are degraded, including 41% significantly narrowed; while 39% of beaches widened (23% significantly). Complete beach loss was noted at only a handful of transects. West Oahu has the widest initial and final average beach widths, though beaches narrowed by 9% - 8% (3.1 - 2.8 m).\\n\\nOf the 10% of beaches armored along west Oahu, 82% are degraded with 80% narrowed (59% significantly) and only 2% completely lost. The average beach width fronting coastal armoring decreased by 37% - 5% (14.4 - 2.1 m). The majority or 58% of unarmored beach also narrowed (40% significantly), while 42% widened (25% significantly). The average change in beach width was not significant along unarmored beaches at 6% - 8% (1.9 - 2.8 m).\\n\\nThe shoreline at the north end of Maili has retreated over 100 m due to chronic erosion and removal of sand by mining operations in the mid-1900s (Hwang 1981) (Fig. 10.12). In spite of the shoreline recession, substantial beach still remains at north Maili. Coastal armoring has only been constructed along a short section (~50 m) to protect a public restroom. The beach is preserved as the vegetation line is allowed to erode into a lightly-developed beach park, which has acted as a buffer between the receding beach and the coastal highway.\\n---\\n# Armoring on Eroding Coasts Leads to Beach Narrowing\\n\\nFig. 10.11 West Oahu\\n---\\n## B.M.

As with Lanikai, none of the rate changes are statistically significant.\\n---\\nArmoring on Eroding Coasts Leads to Beach Narrowing\\n\\n|Island-Wide|386|\\n|---|---|\\n|Over the period of study, average beach width decreased by 11%|4% and nearly|387|\\n|all (95%) documented beach loss was fronting armored coasts. Among armored|388|\\n|beach sections, 72% of beaches are degraded, which includes 43% narrowed (28%|389|\\n|significantly) and 29% (8.6 km) completely lost to erosion. Beaches fronting|390|\\n|coastal armoring narrowed by 36%|5% or 0.10 0.03 m/year, on average.|391|\\n|In comparison, beach widths along unarmored coasts were relatively stable with|392|\\n|slightly more than half (53%) of beaches experiencing any form of degradation.|393|\\n|As mentioned in the introduction, we examine two questions regarding the|394|\\n|effects of coastal armoring on eroding coasts on Oahu. One, does armoring|395|\\n|accelerate pre-existing erosion and does it initiate and or accelerate erosion|396|\\n|on adjacent properties? Two, does armoring lead to other negative impacts|397|\\n|such as beach loss or beach narrowing, which we define as separate from|398|\\n|erosion? Analysis of shoreline change rates preceding and following installation|399|\\n|of armoring suggests accelerated erosion on flanking beaches at several loca-|400|\\n|tions on Oahu after installation of armoring. However, the statistical significance|401|\\n|of some of these rate changes is questionable due largely to limited shoreline|402|\\n|data. Also, the argument could be made that the evidence is somewhat circum-|403|\\n|stantial. It is not possible through our analysis to conclude what proportion of|404|\\n|the documented rate accelerations are due to the influence of coastal armoring|405|\\n|or unrelated coastal dynamics. In response to question two, our analysis has|406|\\n|clearly shown that armoring beaches in response to preexisting erosion leads|407|\\n|to increased beach narrowing and loss by fixing the landward edge of the|408|\\n|beach (vegetation line) and preventing it from receding with the seaward edge|409|\\n|(beach toe).|410|\\n|These results support the findings of Fletcher et al. (1997) that construction of|411|\\n|coastal armoring on eroding beaches of Oahu has contributed to beach narrowing|412|\\n|and loss. However, the cause of narrowing along the majority of unarmored coasts|413|\\n|of west and north Oahu (58% and 69%, respectively) is not clear. The north and|414|\\n|west shores are dominated by beach erosion (Fletcher et al. 2011) so some|415|\\n|narrowing is expected. However, the relatively high percentage of narrowing on|416|\\n|unarmored beaches suggests that movement or stabilization of vegetation lines|417|\\n|by means other than coastal armoring may be a factor.

Such intermittent losses, if significant, could contribute to decreased sand availability and, thus, beach narrowing.\\n\\nHistorical shoreline studies are typically hindered due to limited data (often <10 shorelines). By utilizing all available beach data with WLS regression, rather than an end-point analysis (only two data points), our analysis provides a more statistically defensible analysis of beach width change for highly variable coastal regions like Hawaii.\\n\\nSea level rise is likely to accelerate in coming decades (Vermeer and Rahmstorf 2009) and is almost certain to increase erosion and beach loss along Hawaii shores. With this study we have documented the negative effects of armoring eroding beaches and identified ‘hotspots’ of beach erosion and narrowing – data that may assist coastal resource managers in protecting beaches for future generations through improved management practices.\\n\\n## 10.6 Conclusions\\n\\nCoastal armoring has been a typical response to beach erosion on Oahu, Hawaii. To better understand the effects of armoring on eroding beaches, changes in beach width are compared among armored and unarmored beaches using historical shorelines mapped from aerial photographs. The results from this study show that armoring has contributed to beach narrowing and loss as receding beaches are prevented from migrating upland and sediment is trapped behind structures. Evidence is also provided for increased ‘flanking erosion’ on select beaches adjacent to coastal armoring by increased shoreline erosion rates following installation of armoring.\\n\\nOver 27% of Oahu beaches (or former locations of beach) are armored and the majority, or 72%, of armored beaches are degraded (including 43% narrowed and 29% completely lost to erosion). Virtually all beach loss documented in this study (95%) occurred fronting coastal armoring. The remaining beaches fronting coastal armoring narrowed by 36% - 5%. In contrast, beach widths along unarmored sections were much more stable with percents of degraded and widened beaches roughly even (53% vs. 47%), little or no change in average beach width change (3% - 4%), and little beach loss (1%).\\n\\nThe most armored regions of Oahu, the east and south sides (35% and 39% armored, respectively), suffered the greatest percents of beach loss (14% and 12% lost, respectively). Many of the remaining beaches along armored sections of east Oahu are narrowed to the extent that they likely become unusable at high tide (average beach width 8.7 - 1.0 m). In comparison, the relatively unarmored west and north regions (10% and 12% armored, respectively) experienced little beach loss (0% and 1% lost, respectively). Like south and east Oahu, beaches along armored sections of the west and north shores are highly degraded (82% and 76%, respectively). In all four coastal regions of Oahu the majority of the beach fronting armoring was degraded (between 67% and 82%).

Introduction\\n\\nIt has not been widely documented if historical rates of sea-level rise (SLR) are an important factor in shoreline changes observed on coasts around the world. Zhang et al. (2004) document that on the U.S. east coast rates of coastal erosion are about two orders of magnitude greater than the rate of SLR. However, this has not been confirmed elsewhere and the relative contribution of SLR to regional shoreline change patterns remains debatable. Improved understanding of the influence of SLR on historical shoreline trends will aid in forecasting beach changes with increasing SLR. Globally-averaged sea-level rose at about 2 mm/yr over the past century. Studies indicate that the rate of rise is now approximately 3 mm/yr (Church and White, 2006; Merrifield et al., 2009) and may accelerate over coming decades (Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009).\\n\\nFew datasets embody detailed multi-decadal to century-scale historical shoreline positions on sandy beaches of wave-dominated coasts,\\n\\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Oahu and Maui age (~500–2,000 yrs before present) likely due to changes in carbonate Islands provide a unique opportunity to investigate shoreline trends be- sediment production through the Holocene (Harney et al., 2000; Resig, tween two adjacent islands in similar physical settings and with similar 2004). Sediment storage on the inner reef platform in paleo-karst geomorphologic history (including anthropogenic changes), but with depressions and channels plays an important role in beach sediment significantly differing rates of relative SLR. SLR is only one of many factors supply (Bochicchio et al., 2009; Conger et al., 2009). Sediment may be driving shoreline change. Other drivers of shoreline change that must lost from beaches by abrasion, longshore transport, transport offshore be considered carefully include sediment availability, anthropogenic by wave-driven currents, landward transport by onshore winds, and changes, littoral processes, wave conditions, and coastal and nearshore human activities. Hawaii beaches, like most carbonate beaches, are, geomorphology. Because of these multiple factors, establishing a direct generally, narrower than siliciclastic beaches due to limited available causative link between historical shoreline change and SLR remains a sediment from the nearshore reef and coastal plain. We refer the reader challenge. to Fletcher et al. (2012) for a more thorough discussion of the coastal Using historical shoreline measurements from Fletcher et al. geology of Oahu and Maui on a regional basis.

Fletcher et al. (2012) and Romine and Fletcher (2013) also found that island and regional shoreline trends for Kauai have high uncertainties likely due to high seasonal variability on some Kauai beaches, especially west Kauai. Kauai is excluded from this study where we are attempting to relate SLR and shoreline trends due to the lack of a significant difference between SLR trends for Kauai and Maui and high uncertainty with island-wide shoreline trends for Kauai. Historical shoreline data of comparable quality is not presently available for the other main Hawaiian Islands.\\n\\n## 2. Regional setting\\n\\nThe Hawaii archipelago, including the islands of Oahu and Maui (Figs. 1 and 2), is comprised of eight volcanic islands in the tropics of the central north Pacific. The islands are fringed by carbonate reef platforms built from a complicated patchwork of fossil Pleistocene reefs during interglacial sea-level high stands of the past 500 kyr or so (Fletcher et al., 2008). Analysis of beach sediments in Hawaii shows they are typically comprised of biogenic calcareous debris eroded from nearshore reefs, with a minor fraction of volcanoclastic sediment eroded from adjacent watersheds (Moberly and Chamberlain, 1964; Harney and Fletcher, 2003). Grain size on beaches in Hawaii has been shown to be related to wave and current energy, which, in turn, is largely dependent on coastal aspect (wave exposure) (Moberly and Chamberlain, 1964).\\n\\n158°15’ W 158°00’ 157°45’ 21° Kahuku Point 160°W 158° 156° 45’ N Pacific Ocean 22° Kauai Oahu Hawaiian N Islands North Kahuku Beach Maui Waimea Bay 20° Pacific Ocean Hawaii 0 100 kilometers 0 100 miles Kahana Bay Koolaupoko Kaneohe Bay East (not included) Kailua Beach Barbers Makapuu Point Point\\n\\nFig. 1.

In winter, large north Pacific swells affect north and west exposed shorelines while relatively calm conditions prevail along sheltered southern shores (Vitousek and Fletcher, 2008). In summer, southern hemisphere swells affect exposed southern and western shorelines and calm conditions are typical on north shores. At any time of year, extended periods of high trade wind waves from the east to northeast can cause short-term beach erosion and damage to coastal property on windward shores. Winter storm\\n\\n| |a.

(2012), augmented with new data for the west Maui and north Maui regions, to calculate historical shoreline trends. Below, we provide a summary of the methods for mapping historical shorelines and measuring shoreline change, and refer the reader to Fletcher et al. (2012) for more detail.\\n\\n### Mapping historical shorelines\\n\\nShoreline positions were manually digitized using photogrammetric and geographic information system (GIS) software from orthorectified aerial photo mosaics and topographic and hydrographic survey charts provided by the National Ocean Service (NOS). The low water mark position (LWM) or “beach toe” was mapped as a shoreline proxy. Roughly one historical shoreline is available per decade over the past century. Survey-quality high-resolution (≤0.5 m pixel) vertical aerial photographs with sufficient tonal quality and contrast to resolve shoreline features were used. T-sheets and H-sheets extend the time-span of historical shoreline data beyond available air photos. Survey charts are available as early as 1910 for Oahu and 1899 for Maui.\\n\\n### Positional uncertainties\\n\\nUp to seven sources of positional uncertainty were combined to arrive at a total positional uncertainty for each historical shoreline (Ut, ± 3.2 m to 18.8 m, average 6.8 m). Positional uncertainty was calculated as the root mean square (RMS) of: image rectification (±0.0 to 13.5 m, average 1.9 m), digitization of shoreline position (±0.3 to 8.9 m, average 1.8 m), image pixel size (0.5 m for air photos, 1 to 3 m for charts), seasonal shoreline change (waves) (±1.3 to 14.6 m, average 4.3 m), and tidal fluctuations (±2.5 to 3.1 m, average 3.4 m). Two additional sources of uncertainty are included for T-sheet and H-sheet shorelines: original field survey and plotting of the High Water Mark (HWM) shoreline (±5.1 m) and conversion of the HWM shoreline to a LWM position (±1.2 m to 13.7 m, average 4.3 m). Shoreline positional uncertainties are applied as weights when calculating annual shoreline change rates with weighted least-squares regression.\\n\\n### Calculating shoreline change\\n\\nShoreline movement through time was measured in a GIS at shore-perpendicular transects spaced approximately 20 m along the shore. Annual rates of change are calculated from the time series of shoreline positions at each transect using two methods of weighted least-squares (WLS) regression as a consistency check on shoreline trends: single-transect (ST) and Eigen Beaches (EX). Only wave-exposed beaches are analyzed in this study following Fletcher et al. (2012). The beaches at the back of the wide reef and lagoon system at Kaneohe Bay, Oahu are not included in the study. In addition, the geologically-young northeast and southeast coasts of Maui, flanking Haleakala Volcano, were not included in the study due to the comparative lack of carbonate beaches.\\n\\nFor some beaches historical shoreline trends may have been influenced by human activities. Examples include removal of beach sand by mining operations along north Maui and Oahu beaches in the first half of the 20th century and beach nourishment projects at Waikiki, south Oahu. For this study, we calculate shoreline changes only for the period following major shoreline alterations in an effort to control for human impacts on shoreline changes and identify the natural components of beach change, to the extent possible. Where the beach has been completely lost to erosion (e.g., replaced by a seawall), we calculate shoreline change rates up to and including the first shoreline where the beach was lost.\\n\\nThe single-transect (ST) method is the most commonly utilized method for calculating shoreline change rates. We utilize WLS, with a weight equal to the inverse of the shoreline positional uncertainty (1/Ut). Shorelines with high uncertainty (e.g., T-sheets) will thereby have less influence on the fit of the trend line.\\n\\nWe utilize the EX rate calculation method as a consistency check for rates calculated using ST. The EX method uses shoreline data from all transects on a beach to calculate a rate at each transect, recognizing that shoreline change among neighboring transects is related. A linear combination of eigenvectors — principle components calculated from the shoreline position data — are used as basis functions for modeling alongshore rate variation.\\n\\n|ST (WLS) rate|Shoreline position (m)|\\n|---|---|\\n|-0.4 ± 0.1 m/yr|Shoreline position with ± uncertainty|\\n| |Regression line|\\n| |1920 1940 1960 1980 2000|\\n| |Date|\\n\\nFig. 4.

Historical shoreline positions and transect locations are shown on a portion of a recent aerial photograph.\\n---\\n## Shoreline trend criteria\\n\\nShoreline trend criteria\\nShoreline trend criteria\\n\\nUncertainties of the ST rates are the RMS error (misfit) of the WLS regression line. The EX method as utilized in Frazer et al. (2009) and Genz et al. (2009) may underestimate uncertainties with shoreline change rates. The Frazer et al. and Genz et al. studies effectively treat the Eigen vectors as independent of the shoreline data when estimating uncertainties when, in fact, the Eigen vectors are calculated from the shoreline data. For this study, uncertainties with EX rates are estimated using a non-parametric bootstrap method (Efron, 1981; Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) to re-sample the data with replacement 500 times, producing a probability distribution from which an uncertainty can be calculated. This method produces individual rate uncertainties similar in magnitude to those from the ST method. Rate uncertainties are reported at the 95% confidence interval (95% CI).\\n\\nShoreline change rates and uncertainties are reported from the ST method to remain consistent with other recent studies. The EX method is used only as a consistency check for the ST trends. A rate from ST (or EX) is considered statistically “significant” if the absolute value of the rate is greater than the uncertainty (95% CI); or, in other words, the ± rate uncertainty band does not overlap 0 m/yr.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nTo examine a possible relationship between island shoreline trends and localized rates of SLR, this study provides a re-analysis of the Oahu and Maui shoreline trends from Fletcher et al. (2012) augmented with new data from north and west Maui, and with further consideration of anthropogenic changes to beaches, and using consistency checks of shoreline trends. Shoreline changes are analyzed along 107 km of beach (5332 transects) on Oahu island. Shoreline changes are analyzed along 67 km of beach (3329 transects) on Maui island.\\n\\nBeaches on Oahu were slightly erosional to stable with an overall average shoreline change rate of -0.03 ± 0.03 m/yr (median rate = -0.03 m/yr), whereas Maui beaches were significantly more erosional with an average rate of -0.13 ± 0.05 m/yr (median rate = -0.12 m/yr) (Fig. 5, Table 2). Percentages of eroding and accreting beaches on the two islands, checked for consistency using the ST and EX rate methods, also indicate that Maui beaches are substantially more erosional. Fifty-two percent of beaches on Oahu were erosional over the past century (including 8% completely lost to erosion, Table 3), whereas 78% of beaches on Maui were erosional (including 12% completely lost to erosion). On Oahu, 39% of the beaches were accretional and 9% of beaches had an undetermined trend. On Maui, 17% of beaches were accretional and 5% of beaches had an undetermined trend on Maui.\\n\\nShoreline change is analyzed on a regional basis to explore possible relations between shoreline change and shoreline aspect (wave exposure). No particular side of the two islands (e.g., the north regions) stands out as more erosional than the others (Table 4), thus eliminating unique wave exposure as a causative factor behind island-wide trends.\\n\\nLooking at the four distinct coastal regions of Oahu (north, east, south, and west) and three distinct coastal regions of Maui (north, Kihei, and west), we find that all three coastal regions of Maui are substantially more erosional than the four coastal regions on Oahu (Table 4). In spite of different exposure to seasonal waves, north, Kihei, and west Maui had similar shoreline trends over the past century with regionally-averaged shoreline change rates between -0.12 (west Maui) and -0.15 m/yr (north Maui) (median rates between -0.11 and -0.13 m/yr). Between 73% (north Maui) and 82% (Kihei Maui) of beaches in the three coastal regions of Maui were erosional (including 10% to 14% of beach lost to erosion, Table 5). This is in contrast to the four Oahu coastal regions where regionally-averaged shoreline change rates varied from 0.04 m/yr (east) to -0.09 my/yr (north and west). Between 46% (east Oahu) and 63% (north Oahu) of beaches on Oahu were erosional including between 0% (west) and 13% of beaches completely lost to erosion.\\n\\nUnlike Maui, one region of Oahu stands out as substantially less erosional than the other island regions. The east region of Oahu is the least erosional of the four Oahu regions with a regionally-averaged\\n---\\n## Fig. 5.

Discussion\\n\\nThe islands of Maui and Oahu have similar physical settings and a history of anthropogenic coastal change. However, with significantly differing relative rates of SLR, they provide a unique opportunity to investigate if SLR may be an important driver of shoreline change in Hawaii and elsewhere. Historical shoreline data used in this study provides the only opportunity to observe shoreline changes over the modern period of sea-level rise.\\n\\nGiven the number of other factors driving beach processes, it remains a challenge to conclusively relate observed shoreline changes solely to SLR. Shoreline change is typically a result of multiple physical drivers including impacts to sediment availability, wave conditions, sediment supply, as well as coastal and nearshore geomorphology.\\n\\nTo investigate the role of SLR on Oahu and Maui, we control for the influence of other physical drivers on historical trends.\\n\\nCoastal structures; including seawalls, groins, breakwalls, and other features designed to protect coastal property and retain beach sand; are found in all coastal regions of Oahu and Maui. Coastal armoring in Hawaii has, historically, been a common response to preexisting beach erosion (Fletcher et al., 1997; Romine and Fletcher, 2012). In many locations, beaches have been completely lost to erosion fronting coastal armoring as the water line recedes toward a fixed position. To control for the influence of artificially-fixed shorelines (which would tend to indicate no shoreline change), we calculate trends up to and including the first shoreline after a beach has been lost.\\n\\nCoastal armoring structures may have localized impacts on sediment availability. For example, groins typically lead to impoundment (accretion) of sand on the updrift sides and erosion on downdrift sides. Seawalls lead to “flanking” erosion of adjacent beaches in Hawaii (Romine and Fletcher, 2012). However, the localized effects\\n---\\n## Table 3\\n\\n|Region|Beach lost|Km|% of beach|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Oahu| |8.6|8%|\\n|Maui| |7.9|12%|\\n\\nNo particular region (coastal aspect, wave exposure) of Maui stands out as the most erosional. On Oahu, the east region is noticeably less erosional than the other regions. None of the Maui study regions have a similar east-facing coastal aspect. The East Oahu region also stands out as having the most extensive fringing reef system of the island regions. Perhaps the unique coastal aspect or reef morphology of east Oahu is responsible, in part, for the differences in overall shoreline trends between Oahu and Maui? Removing the east Oahu region from the Oahu island data we find that Oahu remains less erosional than Maui with an average rate for Oahu beaches of -0.07 ± 0.04 m/yr (median rate -0.05 m/yr) and 57% of beaches eroding. This is in comparison to the island-wide results for Maui (including all coastal regions) with an average rate of -0.13 ± 0.05 m/yr (median rate -0.12 m/yr) and 78% of beaches eroding.\\n\\nBeach sand mining and beach nourishment were common on some Oahu and Maui beaches over the past century. Sand mining is documented on Oahu at Waimea Bay, Kahuku, Maile, and Yokohama. On Maui, sand mining was extensive along north shore beaches between Kahului and Paia. Visual inspection of historical shoreline positions shows rapid shoreline recession during the time period of sand mining in these regions with trends typically slowing (or in some cases reversing) following the termination of mining after it was made illegal in the late 1960s. To limit the influence of human-induced shoreline change due to sand mining, we calculate shoreline change rates for these areas using only the historical shorelines post-dating the end of sand mining. Beach nourishment projects were common over the past century along the highly engineered shoreline at Waikiki, south Oahu. Similar to areas of sand mining, we calculate shoreline trends in these areas using shorelines following the most recent beach fill to capture a better representation of natural shoreline trends at these beaches. Removing beaches from the data set for which we have documented evidence of sand mining or beach nourishment (14% of beaches on Oahu, 14% of beaches on Maui) we find little change in average rates (Oahu: -0.03 ± 0.03 m/yr, Maui: -0.12 ± 0.02 m/yr) and percent of eroding beach (Oahu: 54%, Maui: 80%).\\n\\nLocated in the central north Pacific, Hawaii beaches are exposed to large waves year-round from varying directions. Waves are the primary driver of sediment transport in Hawaii. In an island setting, overall shoreline trends are less likely to be influenced by variability in wave energy from one particular source region (wave direction). This is in comparison to mainland settings where beaches throughout a large region are typically exposed to only one or two predominant wave directions and, therefore, shoreline trends are more likely to be affected (biased) by changes in wave climate than in an island setting. Calculating overall shoreline trends for an island environment with exposure to waves from all directions provides an opportunity to control for the influence of variability in wave climate from any particular direction.\\n\\n## Table 4\\n\\n|Region|Shoreline change rate (m/yr)|Mean|Median|Proportion of beach eroding, accreting, or undetermined (% of beach (% significant))|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Oahu North|-0.09 ± 0.06|-0.06| |63% (23%)|25% (4%)|12%|\\n|Oahu East| |0.04 ± 0.04|0.01|46% (22%)|47% (19%)|7%|\\n|Oahu South|-0.05 ± 0.02|-0.01| |48% (24%)|45% (13%)|7%|\\n|Oahu West|-0.09 ± 0.11|-0.11| |62% (21%)|30% (5%)|9%|\\n|Maui North|-0.15 ± 0.14|-0.13| |73% (31%)|20% (2%)|7%|\\n|Maui Kihei|-0.13 ± 0.07|-0.13| |82% (21%)|15% (5%)|2%|\\n|Maui West|-0.12 ± 0.02|-0.11| |78% (36%)|17% (2%)|5%|\\n---\\n|Region|Beach lost|\\n|---|---|\\n|Oahu North|0.2 km|\\n|Oahu East|5.5 km|\\n|Oahu South|2.9 km|\\n|Oahu West|0.0 km|\\n|Maui North|1.6 km|\\n|Maui Kihei|2.1 km|\\n|Maui West|4.2 km|\\n\\nOahu. After removing Kahana and Kailua from the Oahu data, we find that Oahu remains less erosional than Maui with an average rate of -0.05 ± 0.03 m/yr (median rate -0.04 m/yr) and 54% of beaches eroding. Emerged fossil reefs and eolianite formations dating to the Eemian interglacial (Muhs and Szabo, 1994) are a common feature on Oahu coasts, forming many of the headlands and underlying much of the coastal plain. But, Eemian deposits have not been identified on Maui. Headlands on Maui are typically composed of basalt.\\n\\nThe emerged limestone formations do not appear to be an important contributor of beach sands on Oahu, though they do support numerous pocket beaches. In general, areas on Oahu with the most extensive limestone outcrops, including Kahuku, the Ewa Plain, and much of west Oahu are not characterized by particularly large accreting beaches.\\n\\nZhang et al. (2004) document that on the U.S. east coast rates of coastal erosion are about two orders of magnitude greater than the rate of SLR. We find that island-wide rates of shoreline change in Hawaii (centimeters to tens of centimeters per year) are one to two orders of magnitude greater than rates of SLR (millimeters per year).\\n\\n## Acknowledgments\\n\\nThe research described in this paper was carried out by the University of Hawaii Coastal Geology Group with the support of the State of Hawaii; Counties of Kauai, Oahu, and Maui; U.S. Geological Survey; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; NOAA; Hawaii CZM; Hawaii Sea Grant; and the Harold K.L.

Patterns of historical shoreline change are examined for spatial relationships to geomorphology and for temporal relationships to late-Holocene and modern sea-level change. The study area shoreline on the north-east coast of Oahu, Hawaii, is characterized by a series of kilometre-long beaches with repeated headland-embayed morphology fronted by a carbonate fringing reef. The beaches are the seaward edge of a carbonate sand-rich coastal strand plain, a common morphological setting in tectonically stable tropical island coasts. Multiple lines of geological evidence indicate that the strand plain prograded atop a fringing reef platform during a period of late-Holocene sea-level fall. Analysis of historical shoreline changes indicates an overall trend of erosion (shoreline recession) along headland sections of beach and an overall trend of stable to accreting beaches along adjoining embayed sections. Eighty-eight per cent of headland beaches eroded over the past century at an average rate of 0.12 ± 0.03 m yr−1. In contrast, 56% of embayed beaches accreted at an average rate of 0.04 ± 0.03 m yr−1. Given over a century of global (and local) sea-level rise, the data indicate that embayed beaches are showing remarkable resiliency. The pattern of headland beach erosion and stable to accreting embayments suggests a shift from accretion to erosion particular to the headland beaches with the initiation of modern sea-level rise. These results emphasize the need to account for localized variations in beach erosion related to geomorphology and alongshore sediment transport in attempting to forecast future shoreline change under increasing sea-level rise.\\n\\nKeywords: Beach, coastal, erosion, Hawaii, Oahu, sea-level, shoreline.\\n\\n### INTRODUCTION\\n\\nCoastal erosion is a problem in Hawaii (Romine & Fletcher, 2012), on continental shores of the United States (Morton et al., 2004; Morton & Miller, 2005; Hapke et al., 2006, 2010; Hapke & Reid, 2007) and coasts around the world (Bird, 1987). Beach erosion and shoreline recession will increase on a regional to global scale with increasing sea-level rise in coming decades (National Research Council, 2012; IPCC, 2014). However, coastal scientists are limited in their ability to predict shoreline change, particularly on the scale of individual beaches and littoral.\\n\\n© 2016 The Authors. Sedimentology © 2016 International Association of Sedimentologists\\n---\\n## B. M. Romine et al.\\n\\ncells, because shoreline change can be dominated by localized sediment availability and transport, which can act partially or totally independently of sea-level change. Other factors complicating the ability to forecast shoreline change include alongshore and cross-shore variations in geology, lithology and coastal slope. Understanding how beaches will change in a future dominated by sea-level rise requires insights into these localized processes governing historical and modern shoreline changes.\\n\\nSea-level rise has been implicated as a driver of modern (observed) shoreline change for island coasts (Singh, 1997; Ford, 2012; Romine et al., 2013) and continental coasts (Leatherman et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2004; Brunel & Sabatier, 2009; Guitierrez et al., 2011; Yates & Cozannet, 2012). However, the relative roles of coastal geomorphology, sediment availability, human influences and sea-level change in driving shoreline change are not well-understood and add to uncertainty in these studies. These gaps in understanding of the relative influence of individual processes on shoreline change highlight the need for further studies that rely on observational data and models and are applicable at the scale of individual beaches (Le Cozannet et al., 2014).\\n\\nThe reef-fringed coast of Oahu, Hawaii, is typical of other carbonate shoreline systems found on tectonically stable islands in equatorial oceans worldwide. Throughout low-latitude areas of the Pacific and elsewhere, coasts have undergone a unique history of relative sea-level fall during the late Holocene due to post-glacial geoid subsidence followed by recent eustatic sea-level rise due to global warming. Millions of people living on reef-fringed carbonate coasts around the world are exposed to increasing shoreline erosion with accelerating sea-level rise. It is critically important that coastal managers are provided with actionable scientific results that inform new policies to support decision making and planning for improved hazard resilience and resource management.\\n\\nUsing the Oahu coast as a representative setting for carbonate, reef-fringed coasts in equatorial waters, this study addresses gaps in current understanding of the roles that coastal geomorphology, sediment supply and sea-level rise play in shoreline changes at the scale of individual beaches. In particular, this study examines the role that coastal geomorphology and available sediment, which are typically remnants of past sea-level changes, play in alongshore variability.\\n\\n### PHYSICAL SETTING\\n\\nThe island of Oahu, Hawaii, is located in the tropics of the central North Pacific. The coast is fringed by a carbonate reef platform comprised of a patchwork assemblage of fossil Pleistocene reefs from interglacial high sea-level stands of the past several hundred thousand years. Hawaii lies in a microtidal zone (tide range ≤1 m). The northeast Oahu study area is exposed to large waves in winter from the North Pacific (winter months) and predominant trade winds year-round. As a result, wave-generated currents are the primary drivers of sediment transport.\\n---\\nBeach erosion and sea-level rise on carbonate island coasts\\n\\nFig. 1. Shoreline study area (black box) on the north-east coast of Oahu, Hawaii.\\n\\nFig. 2. Low-lying sand-rich coastal plain and beach at Punaluu, east Oahu (view looking south-west). Note the embayed beach fronting the channel in the nearshore reef (left) and headland beach fronting the shallower nearshore reef (right) (photograph by Andrew D. Short, University of Sydney).\\n\\nBeaches along east Oahu, including the study area, are composed primarily of biogenic calcareous sand originally derived from nearshore reefs (Harney & Fletcher, 2003). Volcanoclastic sediment eroded from inland watersheds is typically a minor fraction of beach sand on Oahu. Beaches are typically backed by low-lying coastal plains comprised of a mixture of beach deposits and dunes, lithified carbonate deposits (including fossil reef, beachrock and aeolianite) and alluvium. In many locations, including within the study area, beaches are simply the eroded leading edge of a sand-rich coastal plain (Fletcher et al., 2012).\\n\\nHistorical shoreline studies indicate an overall stable trend (region-wide average) on beaches along east Oahu (Fletcher et al., 2012; Romine & Fletcher, 2012). Like other coastal regions in Hawaii, long-term shoreline trends along east Oahu are highly variable along the shore, when examined at the scale of individual beaches and littoral cells.\\n\\n© 2016 The Authors.

Multiple lines of evidence, including stranded beach deposits, wave-cut notches and geophysical models indicate that sea-level stood roughly 2 m higher than present ca 3500 yr BP around Hawaii (known locally as the ‘Kapapa highstand’). This sea-level history is the result of glacial isostatic adjustment (i.e. geoid subsidence) resulting in variation in oceans in the far field of the ice sheets during the late Holocene and other ‘far-field’ sites in the Pacific. Studies of the lithology and geochronology of coastal plain and beach deposits on Oahu and neighbouring Kauai indicate a late-Holocene age [ca 5000 years BP (Before Present) – near present] for most carbonate sediments with few samples of sand indicating a modern origin. Modern tide gauge records indicate sea-level rise of 1.41 ± 0.22 mm yr-1 on Oahu over the past century. The present authors assume that modern sea-level rise was preceded by a period of falling sea-level subsequent to the Kapapa highstand.\\n\\nThe period leading up to the Kapapa highstand was characterized by invigorated marine carbonate production and deposition due to increased accommodation space for reef growth and flooding of the upper coastal plain around Oahu. Sea-level fall following the Kapapa highstand resulted in an overall trend of shoreline progradation as former beach ridges were stranded on the coastal plain and developed into coastal dunes and cuspate sandy headlands that shape much of the modern-day geomorphology of the low-lying sandy coastal plains.\\n\\nThe shoreline in the study area is characterized by two sinuous beaches, each several kilometres in length, lying atop a carbonate reef platform, with occasional outcrops of beachrock (lithified beach deposits). The beaches are characterized by a sequence of headland and embayed sections of beach. Embayed beaches are typically aligned with watersheds including palaeo-stream channels incised in the shallow reef platform. Cuspate headland beaches are typically aligned with the shallowest portion of the fringing reef platform between channels (drowned interfluves). In most locations not fronting sand-filled channels, the base of the foreshore (beach toe) intersects with the reef with limited sand in the nearshore.\\n\\nA wide shallow-crested fringing reef is typically located a few hundred metres offshore. The upper reef platform is incised by sand-filled palaeo-channels and palaeo-karst features.\\n---\\nBeach erosion and sea-level rise on carbonate island coasts\\n\\nmoderates open ocean wave energy reaching the shoreline. The beaches of north-east Oahu are typically narrow (10 to 30 m wide) compared with most continental settings. Numerous streams cross the coastal plain from inland watersheds, often emptying at the landward 'head' of a reef channel carved by the watershed during lower sea-levels.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\n\\nPreliminary inspection of shoreline trends along the north-east coast of Oahu from Fletcher et al. (2012) suggests an overall pattern of higher annual rates of erosion at headland beaches and comparatively lower rates of change at embayed beaches. This process of headland erosion and embayment infilling is a fundamental principle of coastal morphodynamics and results from concentration of wave energy (erosion) on a headland due to refraction and reduced wave energy in the embayment due to wave dispersion (deposition and accretion).\\n\\nHistorical shorelines\\n\\nHistorical shoreline positions and rates of change over the past century are adapted from previous work. A summary is provided below of the methods used to measure historical shoreline change herein and also refers the reader to Fletcher et al. (2012) and Romine & Fletcher (2012) for more detail.\\n\\nHistorical shoreline changes were calculated over the past ca 80 years (1927 to 2006) for roughly 14 km of beach along north-east Oahu. Erosion and accretion is measured from shoreline positions digitized using photogrammetric and geographic information system (GIS) software from orthorectified aerial photographs and survey charts over the period 1927 to 2006. Ten or eleven historical shoreline positions are available within the study area, providing relatively good temporal coverage (Oahu ranges from three to twelve historical shorelines).\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nErosion rate uncertainties from Fletcher et al. (2012) were calculated at the 95% confidence interval (CI, 2-sigma). The present study recalculated rate uncertainties at the 80% CI due to the\\n---\\n## B. M.

To delineate boundaries between headland and embayed sections of beach, a polynomial shoreline model (Legendre Polynomial, black line) is fit to historical shoreline positions (grey shorelines) using least squares regression. Boundaries between headlands and bays (filled circles) are located by differentiating the shoreline model to identify changes in curvature (inflection points) between headland and embayed sections of beach. Smaller scale changes in curvature (open circles) may be omitted through visual interpretation. Example shown from Malaekahana and Laie bays, north-east Oahu.\\n\\nhigh uncertainties typical of historical shoreline change rates.\\n\\nOnce headland and embayed beaches are identified, a comparison between shoreline change trends is conducted for the different geomorphic segments. Mean and median shoreline change rates, as well as the percentage of beach with an erosion or accretion trend are calculated. A mean rate for a section of beach (for example, a headland or embayment) is the average of all shoreline change rates from transects within that section.\\n\\nThe uncertainty of an average rate is calculated following Hapke et al. (2010) and Bayley & Hammersley (1946) (also described and utilized in Romine et al., 2013) using an effective number of independent uncertainty observations (n*) calculated from a spatially lagged autocorrelation of the rate uncertainties at individual transects along the shore. Uncertainties with individual and average shoreline change rates are reported at the 80% CI.

Six segments (6.5 km in total) of shoreline are identified as headland beaches and seven segments (7.7 km in total) of shoreline are identified as embayed beaches. Of particular note, the shoreline at Lanioloa has characteristics of both a headland and embayed beach and may be classified as a partially embayed headland. This study identifies Laniloa as a headland beach, to be consistent with the spatial scale of other headlands identified in the study area and because earlier historical shorelines at this location exhibited stronger headland-like morphology.\\n\\nOverall, beaches within the study area exhibited a slightly erosional trend over the past century with an average rate of 0.03-0.03 m yr 1 (median rate 0.03 m yr 1) and 65% of beaches indicating a trend of erosion, although only 29% of these are significant at the 80% CI. Approximately 2.7 km of the study beaches were completely lost to erosion in the past century – nearly all of it (98%) fronting coastal armouring (for example, seawalls).\\n\\nOver the past century sections of headland beach in the study area were significantly more erosional than embayed beaches (80% CI). Headland beaches eroded at an average rate of 0.12-0.03 m yr 1 (median rate 0.11 m yr 1) while embayed beaches were slightly accretional overall, with an average rate of 0.04-0.03 m yr 1 (median rate 0.01 m yr 1). The majority (88%) of transects along headland beaches had a trend of erosion, whereas the majority (56%) of transects along embayed beaches had a trend of accretion. Of the eroding transects, 63% were located along headlands and 37% were located within embayments. Of accreting transects, 85% were located within embayments and 15% were located along headlands.\\n\\n### Table 1.

Strand plain deposits of similar age are common throughout tropical oceans along tectonically stable coasts. Headland beaches in the study area herein are characterized by higher rates of erosion compared to adjacent embayed beaches, which are stable or accreting. The observed spatial pattern of ‘preferential’ headland beach erosion suggests an overall shift from accretion to erosion particular to the headlands with the initiation of modern sea-level rise. Embayed beaches fronting channels in the nearshore reef are showing surprising resilience to sea-level rise because the beaches are maintained through sediment pathways between the eroding headlands and/or nearshore sand bodies. This pattern of headland erosion and bay infilling is a fundamental coastal process but is not well-documented on carbonate reef-fringed coasts prior to this study.\\n\\nThe results of this study show that beach response to sea-level rise in similar reef-fringed carbonate settings will depend strongly on localized coastal geomorphology, nearshore wave processes and sediment transport. As a result, some portions of beach may be expected to accrete under sea-level rise as eroded sediment is transported alongshore from adjacent sections of beach undergoing relatively high rates of erosion. Thus, even under conditions of sea-level rise, beach response will depend on sediment availability. In addition, asymmetrical patterns of erosion and accretion along headland and embayed beaches are inferred to result from predominant wave climate and resulting net longshore sediment transport.\\n\\nThese observations of historical shoreline change have important implications for coastal management and planning for sea-level rise for beaches on reef-fringed tropical coasts. Methods used to forecast shoreline change with sea-level rise, such as beach profile equilibrium models and digital models of coastal inundation, tend to predict fairly uniform shoreline retreat given similar topography along the shore. The results of this study show that differential erosion of certain coastal geomorphic features (for example, headland beaches) and sediment transport within a littoral cell must be accounted for when attempting to forecast shoreline change with sea-level rise.\\n\\n© 2016 The Authors.

West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.\\n\\nShoreline change was measured along the beaches of Kauai, Oahu, and Maui (Hawaii) using historical shorelines digitized from aerial photographs and survey charts for the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Assessment of Shoreline Change. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive report on shoreline change throughout Hawaii and supplements the limited data on beach changes in carbonate reef–dominated systems. Trends in long-term (early 1900s–present) and short-term (mid-1940s–present) shoreline change were calculated at regular intervals (20 m) along the shore using weighted linear regression. Erosion dominated the shoreline change in Hawaii, with 70% of beaches being erosional (long-term), including 9% (21 km) that was completely lost to erosion (e.g., seawalls), and an average shoreline change rate of 20.11 ± 0.01 m/y. Short-term results were somewhat less erosional (63% erosional, average change rate of 20.06 ± 0.01 m/y). Maui, Hawaii, beaches were the most erosional of the three islands with 85% of the beaches erosional, including 11% lost, and an average change rate of 20.17 ± 0.01 m/y. Seventy-one percent of Kauai, Hawaii, beaches were erosional, including 8% lost, with an average change rate of 20.11 ± 0.01 m/y. Most (60%) of the Oahu, Hawaii, beaches were erosional, including 8% lost, with an average change rate of 20.06 ± 0.01 m/y. Short-term results for Maui, Hawaii, and Oahu, Hawaii, were roughly the same as those found in the long term. Short-term analysis for Kauai, Hawaii, was less conclusive with an accretional average rate, but most of the beaches were erosional. Spatially, shoreline change is highly variable along the Hawaii beaches (length scales of hundreds of meters). Areas of chronic erosion were identified on all sides of the islands.\\n\\nADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: Coastal erosion, shoreline recession, Pacific islands, National Assessment of Shoreline Change, DSAS.\\n\\n## INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe University of Hawaii Coastal Geology Group, in conjunction with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), recently completed an analysis of historical shoreline change along the beaches of Kauai, Oahu, and Maui, Hawaii, as part of the USGS National Assessment of Shoreline Change Project (Fletcher et al., 2012; Romine et al., 2012; USGS, 2012). To our knowledge, this work is the first to report on shoreline changes throughout the Hawaii archipelago at high spatial and temporal resolution. This study provides important data on shoreline changes to U.S. coasts and on carbonate beach systems throughout the world. In an era of accelerating sea level rise (Merrifield, Merrifield, and Mitchum, 2009), it is vital that the scientific community closely monitor shoreline changes because there is limited understanding about how shorelines will respond.\\n\\nChronic coastal erosion is a problem along most of the U.S. coast, including the carbonate beaches of Hawaii (e.g., Crowell and Leatherman, 1999; Fletcher et al., 2004; Hapke et al., 2006; Hapke et al., 2010; Morton and Miller, 2005; Morton, Miller, and Moore, 2004). Coastal resource managers benefit from site-specific knowledge of historical shoreline change, assuming that historical changes have a relationship to future vulnerability to erosion. In the absence of a widely accepted physical model, historical shoreline positions can be used to characterize shoreline variability (National Academy of Sciences, 1990). Here, we report on our measurement of ‘‘chronic’’ shoreline change (decadal–century) on the three most populated Hawaiian Islands: Kauai, Oahu, and Maui, using historical shorelines mapped from air photos and survey charts. Shoreline changes were measured over two periods: long term (all available data, early 1900s–present) and short term (mid-1940s–present) as a rudimentary investigation into whether shoreline change rates have changed over time.\\n\\n## Geologic Setting\\n\\nThe Hawaii island chain comprises eight major volcanic islands in the tropics of the central North Pacific. The islands increase in age to the northwest with distance from actively growing Hawaii Island. The islands are built of one or more volcanoes that rise from the sea floor. The islands are surrounded by fringing reefs that are separated from the shore by shallow lagoons. The islands are located in the trade wind belt and receive abundant rainfall on their windward sides. The leeward sides of the islands are generally dry. The islands are located in the middle of the Pacific Plate, far from any plate boundaries. The islands are located in the tropics and are subject to tropical storms and hurricanes.\\n\\nPublished Pre-print online XX Month XXXX.\\n\\n* Corresponding author.\\n\\n’ Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2012\\n---\\nRomine and Fletcher\\n\\n|Kauai|Hawaiian Islands|Kainjte|Kabubu|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Oahu|Maul|Halet ?|East|\\n|PaicincCecan|Hawaii|Poki|Oahu|Kams|\\n|IDD kilometers| |West|Valani|\\n|DD mles|Mautkicmeiers|Pnan|Wailk|\\n|159723|159\"15|Miics|South|\\n|mile3|Hanalei Bay|North|Kauainal|Kaluiui|5 klanefs|\\n|Pauinale|Kauai|Kadia|West|\\n|Mar $|Koki _|South|Larb|\\n\\nFigure 1.

Rejuvenated volcanism may add new land to island coasts hundreds of thousands to millions of years following the end of the main shield building stage. The geology of Hawaiian coasts is typically characterized by volcanic bedrock, alluvial deposits from the volcanic interior, and carbonate deposits. Carbonate eolianite (Fletcher et al., 2005), exposed reef formations (Muhs and Szabo, 1994; Szabo et al., 1994), and beachrock (Meyers, 1987) are found on many Hawaii beaches and form headlands and nearshore islets (Fletcher and Jones, 1996) on some coasts, especially Oahu, Hawaii.\\n\\nAll but the youngest portions of the islands are fringed by a complex reef platform formed by a mosaic of reef accretion during the late-Pleistocene high sea-level stands. Modern reef growth is typically limited to a thin veneer in wave-exposed regions (Grigg, 1998) with most reef accretion occurring in wave-protected settings with sufficient accommodation space and on the reef-front below the effects of damaging waves (Fletcher et al., 2008). Hawaiian fringing reefs are incised by\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 00, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\n## Hawaii Shoreline Changes\\n\\nFigure 2.

Short, University of Sydney).\\n\\nVary with distance from Hawaii Island because of differences southerly winds and waves, can cause temporary erosion to in lithospheric flexure from the weight of actively growing south- and west-exposed beaches. Infrequent hurricanes can affect any coast, with the most recent example, Hurricane Iniki in 1992, causing extensive damage on the coasts of Kauai, Oahu, and Maui, Hawaii.\\n\\nMaui, Hawaii, closest of the three islands in this study to the Hawaii Island, has the greatest rate of relative sea level rise at 2.32 ± 0.53 mm/y (NOAA, 2012). Sea level rise is roughly 65% slower around Kauai and Oahu, Hawaii, at 1.53 ± 0.59 mm/y and 1.50 ± 0.25 m/y, respectively. Accelerated sea level rise seen in global records has not been detected in the Hawaii tide-gauge records (Church and White, 2006; Merrifield, Merrifield, and Mitchum, 2009).\\n\\nOcean waves arrive from four dominant regimes in Hawaii (Moberly and Chamberlain, 1964; Vitousek and Fletcher, 2008). In the northern hemisphere, during winter, powerful North Pacific swells affect the north- and west-exposed coasts, and occasionally, large N to NE swells affect the eastern shores. In summer, smaller, long-period South Pacific swells affect south- and west-exposed coasts. Persistent easterly trade winds and the short-period waves they create are common year-round but are strongest and most frequent in the summer. High trade-wind events may cause extensive erosion to windward beaches. Occasional winter ‘‘Kona’’ storms, with southerly winds and waves, can cause temporary erosion to south- and west-exposed beaches.\\n\\nData and Methods\\n\\nWe adhered closely to the methods of Fletcher et al. (2004) and Romine et al. (2009) for mapping historical shoreline positions and calculating positional uncertainties. We provide a summary of those methods here and refer the reader to those publications and to Fletcher et al. (2012) for more detail.\\n\\nHistorical shoreline positions were mapped from orthorectified, aerial photo mosaics and topographic survey charts (T-sheets). Typically, one historical shoreline is available approximately every decade going back to the early 1900s. We digitize a low water mark (LWM) or beach ‘‘toe’’ position as the shoreline proxy using geographic information system (GIS) software.\\n\\nOnly survey-quality, high-resolution (#0.5 m pixel), vertical aerial photographs with sufficient tonal quality and contrast to\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 00, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\nRomine and Fletcher resolve shoreline features were used for mapping historical\\n\\nshorelines. New aerial photographs were acquired for Kauai, Oahu, and southwest Maui, Hawaii, coasts between 2005 and 2008 and were rectified and mosaicked in photogrammetric software. The orthorectification process employs synchronous positional and orientation system data from the aircraft global positioning system, the inertial mobilization unit, and a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM; 5 m horizontal, submeter vertical). Recent (1997 and 2002) aerial photographs for north and west Maui, Hawaii, were orthorectified using ground control points (GCPs) collected in a differential global positioning system survey and a 10-m, horizontal-resolution DEM. Older aerial photographs were sourced from local vendors, libraries, and archives and were georeferenced in photogrammetric software using GCPs collected from a more-recent orthophoto mosaic with a 5-m DEM. The orthorectification process typically produced mosaics with a root mean square (RMS) error less than 2 m.\\n\\nGeoreferenced T-sheets as early as 1927 for Kauai, Hawaii; 1910 for Oahu, Hawaii; and 1899 for Maui, Hawaii, were obtained from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service. Rectification of T-sheets was verified by overlaying them on a modern orthorectified aerial photograph in a GIS to compare fit with unchanged coastal features (e.g., rocky headlands). If necessary, the georeference of the T-sheets was improved using polynomial rectification models in the photogrammetric software, typically achieving RMS errors less than 4 m. The original surveyors working on T-sheets typically mapped a high waterline (HWL) as the shoreline proxy. To include a T-sheet shoreline with LWM shorelines from aerial photos in our study, a T-sheet HWL was migrated to a LWM using an offset calculated from data collected in biannual beach-profile measurements (Gibbs et al., 2001) (C.H. Fletcher, B.M. Romine, T.R. Anderson, and M. Dyer, unpublished data) from the study beach or a nearby beach with similar littoral characteristics. The HWL–LWM migration distance was equal to the median of the measured distances between the HWL and the LWM from the profile surveys.\\n\\nBecause historical shoreline data sets are typically sparse and noisy, we attempted to use all available historical shorelines from air photos and T-sheets that met minimum quality standards and did not attempt to remove shorelines from the data set based on records of storms or large waves. We account for variability due to waves and storms in our uncertainty calculations. An exception was the historical shoreline for Kauai, Hawaii, from 1992, following the destructive Hurricane Iniki, which was not included. Shorelines were also removed from the data set in the following special situations. We attempted to reduce temporal bias on the shoreline trends by removing historical shorelines that fell within 2 years of another shoreline (the shoreline with the lower positional uncertainty was retained). Some beaches had been altered by human activity (engineering), such as the construction of coastal armoring, artificial beach fill, and sand mining, to an extent that the physics of the beach had been permanently altered. In those cases, we calculated the shoreline change rates using only shorelines that followed the major engineering efforts in an attempt to capture the present dynamics of the beach. Where the beach had been completely lost to erosion (e.g., replaced by a seawall), we calculated a rate using the historical shoreline up to and including the first shoreline indicating no beach.\\n\\nHistorical shoreline positions derived from aerial photographs depict the shoreline at a single instant but represent the shoreline location for a decade or more in a historical shoreline data set. Therefore, it is important to rigorously identify and calculate positional uncertainties resulting from short-term (hourly to interannual) variability and the mapping process. We calculated up to seven sources of uncertainty for each historical shoreline: (1) the RMS error of the image rectification process (60.1–7.3 m), (2) the on-screen identification and digitization of shoreline position (60.5–9.7 m), (3) the image pixel size (resolution: 0.5 m for air photos, 1 to 3 m for T-sheets), (4) the seasonal shoreline fluctuations due to waves (61.2–19.9 m), (5) the horizontal variability due to tides (62.0–6.0 m), (6) the original field survey and plotting of T-sheet shorelines (applied to T-sheet shorelines only; 65.1 m) (Shalowitz, 1964), and (7) the conversion of T-sheet HWM to LWM shoreline positions (61.0–13.8 m) (Table 1). The individual uncertainties were combined as a root sum of squares to arrive at a total positional uncertainty, Ut, for each historical shoreline.\\n\\nChanges in shoreline position were measured, and annual shoreline change rates were calculated in ArcGIS version 9.3 using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System version 4.2 (DSAS, Thieler et al., 2009). Changes in shoreline position were measured at regularly spaced (roughly 20 m), shore-perpendicular transects cast from an arbitrary offshore baseline. We report the shoreline change rates calculated independently at each transect using weighted least squares (WLS) regression, which applied the individual shoreline uncertainties as a weight (1 - U2t), so that shorelines with higher positional uncertainty (typically older shorelines) had less influence on the trend line. The uncertainty in the annual shoreline change rates (m/y) are reported at the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Rates were calculated for long-term (all available shorelines) and short-term (1940s to near present) data to provide verification of chronic trends and insight into whether rates may have changed with time (Table 2).\\n\\nWe report regional, average shoreline-change rates as the mean of shoreline-change rates from all transects in a region. The uncertainty of a regional average rate is the root sum of the squares of the rate uncertainties from all transects. That calculation often leads to uncertainties on the order of a few centimeters per year. To avoid reporting some average rates as\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 00, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\n## Hawaii Shoreline Changes\\n\\nRate: -0.4 * 0.1 meters per year\\n\\n1920 1940 1960 Year 1980 2000 2010\\n\\nEXPLANATION\\n\\nShoreline position with 95-percent confidence interval\\n\\nRegression line\\n\\nFigure 3.

More than 21 km or 9% of the total length of the beaches studied was completely lost to erosion within the period of analysis. In nearly all cases, the beaches lost were replaced by seawalls or other coastal armoring. Short-term analysis also indicated an overall erosional trend, although the rate and extent of beach erosion appears to have slowed somewhat, with an overall average rate of 20.06 ± 0.01 m/y and 63% of beaches that were erosional.

In general, high alongshore rate variability made this sort of comparison difficult. A comparison of the west regions of Kauai and Oahu, Hawaii, provided the most interesting example of dissimilarity in shoreline behavior between similar geographic regions. The Mana Plain of west Kauai, Hawaii, has been accreting through the late Holocene based on interpretation of the coastal geomorphology (Moberly et al., 1963) and appears to be stable to accreting during the past century. In contrast, the west side of Oahu, Hawaii, is erosional along most of its length. Differences in gross island morphology may be the primary reason for the difference in shoreline behavior among the west coasts. The approximately round shape of Kauai, Hawaii, and its lack of major headlands on NW and SW shores promote wave refraction and allow generally uninterrupted sand transport toward its western end from both the north and south. In contrast, the west Oahu shoreline is approximately linear as a whole and is punctuated by smaller headlands that divide the coast into distinct littoral cells. The north shores of the three islands seem to exhibit the most similar shoreline-change behavior among similar geographic regions with conclusive overall trends of erosion. However, the similarities appear to end there. Shoreline change on smaller spatial scales seems to be more related to local shoreline dynamics and sediment budgets, and other large-scale spatial correlations are not obvious.\\n\\nAbout 22 km or 9% of beaches studied were completely lost to erosion during the period of analysis. In Hawaii, the historically common response to beach erosion has been to armor the back-beach in an effort to protect beachfront property with seawalls or other engineered structures. Fletcher, Mullane, and Richmond (1997) and Romine and Fletcher (2012) show that armoring eroding beaches in Hawaii has led to much of the beach loss observed in this study. Armoring eroding beaches typically leads to narrowing and, ultimately, complete loss of a beach because the waterline continues to recede landward toward the fixed shoreline. Evidence for increased flanking erosion adjacent to armoring was documented in Romine and Fletcher (2012).\\n\\nRates of shoreline change were influenced by other human activities on some beaches in Hawaii. Removal of beach sand by mining operations was common on island beaches in early and mid-1900s. Those operations were observed in aerial photographs used in this study. That practice caused tens to hundreds of meters of shoreline retreat at many beaches, including Waimea Bay, Kahuku, and Maile on Oahu, Hawaii, and Baldwin Park on Maui, Hawaii. Sand removal from beaches was outlawed in the early 1970s, and erosion appears to have slowed in recent decades at several mined beaches. Other examples of human influences on shoreline change rates included construction of groins and breakwalls and artificial beach fills. Reduction in the average shoreline change rate for the islands in the short term (20.06 ± 0.01 m/y) compared with the long term (20.11 ± 0.01 m/y) may be attributed, in part, to the cessation of sand mining and the increased artificial stabilization of shorelines in the second half of the 1900s.\\n\\nBeach erosion is likely to increase in Hawaii and globally with accelerating sea level rise in coming decades (Merrifield, Merrifield, and Mitchum, 2009; Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009). It is not known how individual beaches will respond to increasing rates of sea level. It is likely that increasing sea level will raise the rate and extent of erosion in areas of historical shoreline retreat. Therefore, we have identified coastal areas most at risk for increasing erosion in coming decades—information that will be useful to those responsible for coastal hazard mitigation and management. Continued monitoring of beaches with updates to this and similar studies will be vital in coming decades to better understand beach response to changing climate.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 00, No. 0, 0000\\n---\\n## Hawaii Shoreline Changes\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nOur results provide insight to shoreline change in the Hawaiian Islands during the past century. Shoreline change on Hawaiian beaches is dominated by erosion. More than 21 km or 9% of the total extent of beach on Kauai, Oahu, and Maui, Hawaii, was lost to erosion during the past century. Maui, Hawaii, was clearly the most erosional of the three islands with the greatest average long-term and short-term shoreline-change rates and the greatest percentages of transects indicating erosion; although, Kauai and Oahu, Hawaii, beaches were also erosional overall. Shoreline change in Hawaii is highly spatially variable. Cells of erosion and accretion were characterized by length scales of hundreds of meters on continuous beaches. Along much of the coast, headlands divide the shoreline into many small embayments with pocket beaches that exhibited a range of shoreline-change behavior—some erosional and some accretional. Significant areas of chronic beach erosion were found on all sides of the islands.\\n\\nChronic erosion threatens coastal development and will lead to further beach loss if beaches are not allowed to recede naturally where the coastal plain is composed of sand. Beach erosion will become an increasing problem in Hawaii in coming decades should the rate of sea level rise accelerate as predicted. With this study, we have identified sections of the shoreline that pose the highest risk of future erosion, assuming that past trends of shoreline change have a relationship to future vulnerability to erosion. Information from this study will help Hawaii decision-makers protect beaches for future generations. This work also provides information for the coastal research community, which is assessing shoreline change on coasts around the world in the face of changing climate and rising sea levels.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nThe research described in this article was carried out by the University of Hawaii Coastal Geology Group with the support of the U.S. Geological Survey; the State of Hawaii; the counties of Kauai, Oahu, and Maui, Hawaii; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; NOAA; Hawaii CZM; Hawaii Sea Grant; and the Harold K.L.

Within the last century many beaches on Oahu have narrowed or been completely lost to coastal erosion (Hwang 1981; Sea Engineering 1988; Fletcher, et al. 1997). Coastal development and sea-level rise due to climate change threaten Oahu’s remaining beaches. With the goal of helping to protect southeast Oahu’s beaches through science-based land use planning and regulation, historical shorelines are mapped from aerial photographs and survey charts and shoreline change rates are calculated.\\n\\nThe recently developed PX (Polynomial in alongshore X) and PXT (Polynomial X and Time) shoreline change methods are employed in modeling shoreline change. These new methods often produce statistically significant change rates (statistically discernible from a rate of 0 m/yr) where the previously used ST (Single-Transect) method cannot (Frazer, et al. in press; Genz, et al. in press). PXT can model acceleration in the shoreline change rate – an important advance, as beaches may not erode or accrete at a constant (linear) rate. Here we report on the overview of the PX and PXT shoreline change rate methods and present results from the applications of these methods on four beach sites on the southeast Oahu, Hawaii, shoreline (Figure 1).\\n\\nFigure 1. Southeast Oahu beach study sites.\\n\\n## METHODS\\n\\nMAPPING HISTORICAL SHORELINES\\n\\nFor this study we adhere closely to the methods of Fletcher, et al. (2003) used in mapping historical shorelines on Maui, Hawaii. A combination of NOAA NOS topographic maps (t-sheets) and high-resolution (0.5 m) vertical aerial photo mosaics are used to determine historical shoreline positions (low water mark) and calculate long-term erosion rates.\\n\\nAerial photographs are orthorectified and mosaicked, usually achieving root mean square (RMS) positional error < 2 m. T-sheets are rectified through various\\n---\\n## Transformations in PCI with RMS errors < 4 m\\n\\nRectification of t-sheets is also verified by their fit to hard rocky shoreline and other typically unchanging geological features in aerial photo mosaics. Previous workers have addressed the accuracy of t-sheets (Shalowitz 1964; Crowell, et al. 1991; Daniels and Huxford 2001) finding that they meet national map accuracy standards (Ellis 1978) and recommending them for use in shoreline change studies as a valuable source for extending the time series of historical shoreline position (NAS 1990). Historical shoreline positions are digitized in a GIS from the rectified images.\\n\\n## Calculating Shoreline Change Rates\\n\\nPrevious studies (e.g., Norcross, et al. 2002; Maui Shoreline Atlas 2003; Hapke 2006) have utilized the ST (Single-Transect) method to calculate shoreline change rates from a time series of historical shoreline positions. ST, employed in recent studies (Fletcher, et al. 2003), calculates a shoreline change rate and uncertainty at each shoreline transect using re-weighted weighted least squares linear regression. This method accounts for the total positional uncertainty, Et, at each historical shoreline position, excludes outliers, and fits a trend line to the time series of historical shoreline positions (Fletcher, et al. 2003; Genz, et al. 2007). The weight for each shoreline position is equal to the inverse of the uncertainty squared (wi = 1/Et2). Shoreline positions with higher uncertainty will have less influence on the trend line than data with smaller uncertainty. The slope of the line is the shoreline change rate.\\n\\nRecent work by Frazer, et al. (in press) and Genz, et al. (in press) identify a number of problems with the ST method. ST often produces unparsimonious models, i.e., it tends to over-fit the data by using more mathematical parameters than necessary to model the change at a beach since it assumes adjacent transects are independent. In theory, adjacent transects should tell a similar story about the change occurring at a beach because beach positions share sand along the shore. Instead, ST assumes shoreline positions at a transect are independent of those at other transects, treating the beach as if it were a set of blocks centered at each transect that move independently of each other. In addition, ST produces many rates that are not statistically significant, i.e., the rates are statistically indistinguishable from a rate of 0.0 m/yr. Lastly, short-term fluctuations in the beach due to seasonal and tidal changes (high complexity) and a lack of historical shoreline data (poor sampling) can mask the long-term trend when attempting to calculate a change rate from a single transect’s data.\\n\\nTo address these problems, Frazer, et al. (in press) and Genz, et al. (in press) developed the PX (Polynomial in alongshore X) method for calculating shoreline change rates to produce more meaningful, i.e., statistically significant and defensible, shoreline change rates. PX combines shoreline positions and uncertainties from all transects on a beach and models shoreline change for the entire length of beach using weighted least squares polynomial regression. Like the ST method, shoreline uncertainties are propagated to the calculated rate uncertainty using PX. Exponential decay functions are derived from the shoreline data and included in calculation of the shoreline change model to describe the correlation of data from adjacent transects.\\n---\\nThe PX shoreline change models produce rates that vary continuously in the alongshore direction. These models employ information from the entire beach to model the rate at any one location.\\n\\nAn advancement of the PX method, called PXT (Polynomial in X and Time) method, was developed to model shoreline change rates that vary continuously in the alongshore direction and with time (Figure 2). For sufficient data, PXT can find acceleration in the shoreline change rate – an important advance, as some beaches may not erode or accrete at a constant (linear) rate. The PX and PXT methods often give meaningful, i.e., statistically defensible, change rates for beaches where ST cannot (Table 2).\\n\\nFigure 2.

Three basis functions are tested: Legendre polynomials (LX), trigonometric functions (sines and cosines, RX), and principal components (eigenvectors, EX) of the shoreline data. For PXT, in which the rate of shoreline change varies through time (acceleration or deceleration), the models are referred to as LXT, RXT, and EXT. For a transect\\n---\\nwhere acceleration or deceleration is identified, the reported shoreline change rates and uncertainties are from the most recent shoreline position, i.e. the “present” rate. However, a rate may be calculated from the model at any point in the time series.\\n\\nIC (objective Information Criteria, we use Akaike method) is used to find the optimal polynomial for each of the six different model types (LX, RX, EX, LXT, RXT, EXT) and in a similar manner identifies the overall “best” shoreline change model among all models tested. Various IC’s have been tested and may be employed in comparing shoreline change models (Frazer, et al. in press). In general, IC’s provide an optimal compromise between limited number of model parameters (parsimony) and goodness of fit (residual errors). The IC formula calculates a relative score for each model, which increases as the number of model parameters increases and decreases as the residual errors decrease. The model with the lowest IC score is determined to be the best model to describe the shoreline change at a beach. IC may choose a model with no change (0 m/yr or “null model”) if it is determined to be a better fit than models with parameters (showing shoreline change).\\n\\n## RESULTS\\n\\nKailua Beach (Figure 3), 4 km long, is a crescent-shaped beach bounded to the north by Kapoho Point and to the south by Alala Point. Low vegetated dunes have formed in front of many properties in central Kailua, evidence of an accreting beach. Erosion has affected the beach fronting Kailua Beach Park in the south. Analysis of Kailua Beach is divided into two sections with a boundary at Kaelepulu Stream. The two study regions are named Kailua Beach (Kapoho Pt – Kaelepulu Stream) and South Kailua Beach (Kaelepulu Stream – Alala Pt). The shoreline data from the beach at Kaelepulu Stream mouth is not considered reliable, as it is prone to fluctuations related to stream flow.\\n\\nIn the Kailua Beach section, IC identifies EXT as the best model to describe shoreline change for the years 1928 - 2005. A maximum accretion rate of 0.70 ± 0.15 m/yr occurs toward the north end of Kailua Beach. The maximum erosion rate is -1.02 ± 0.12 m/yr at the north side of Kailua Beach Park. The shoreline change rate for Kailua Beach averaged along the length of the beach is 0.06 (accretion). The average uncertainty of the EXT rates is ± 0.13 m/yr versus ± 0.22 m/yr for ST. EXT finds statistically significant rates at 90% of transects versus for 81% for ST. The EXT shoreline change model finds a trend of decelerating accretion shifting to accelerating erosion at the southern end of Kailua Beach.\\n---\\n## Kailua Beach Shoreline Change Rates, m/yr; 1928 - 2005\\n\\nFigure 3. Shoreline change rates (m/yr) at Kailua Beach, 1928-2005. The study site is divided into two sections by a model boundary at Kaelepulu Stream. IC determines EXT, with acceleration in the change rate with time, is the best shoreline change model for Kailua Beach. ST and EX (non-acceleration) rates are shown for comparison.\\n\\nLanikai (Figure 4) is a slightly embayed 2 km-wide headland between Alala and Wailea Points with a narrow 800 m long beach in the north-central portion. The remainder of the northern and southern Lanikai shoreline presently has no beach at high tide and has been armored with concrete seawalls and other revetments. Shoreline change analysis for Lanikai Beach looks at historical shorelines from 1911-2005 and includes only the areas with beach in the most recent air photos.\\n\\nAgain, IC identifies EXT as the best model to describe shoreline change. The maximum accretion rate of 1.58 ± 0.18 m/yr occurs near the north-central section. The maximum erosion rate, -0.63 ± 0.13 m/yr occurs near the northern end. The beach is presently accreting at 0.55 m/yr, when averaged along the entire length. The mean uncertainty of the EXT rates is ± 0.13 m/yr versus ± 0.21 m/yr for ST. EXT finds statistically significant rates at 94% of transects versus 66% for ST. The EXT model finds recent accelerating accretion around the center of the study area. EXT also finds accelerating erosion at the far north and south ends. These results suggest that a significant fraction of the sand from eroded areas of Lanikai is accreting at central Lanikai.\\n---\\n## Lanikai Beach: Shoreline Change Rates 1911-2005\\n\\nS-T 8105\\n\\nEXT 1\\n\\nFigure 4.

ST and EX (non-acceleration) rates are shown for comparison. Areas of Lanikai with no beach in the most recent aerial photographs are not analyzed.\\n\\nBellows and Waimanalo Beach (Figures 5 and 6), 6.2 km long, is a nearly continuous beach extending from the northern end of Bellows Field (near Wailea Point) to Kaiona Beach Park in southern Waimanalo. The beach is interrupted at two locations by jetties at Waimanalo Stream and the remains of a similar structure at Inaole Stream. The shoreline at the northern end of Bellows Field has been armored with stone revetments. No beach currently exists in this area at high tide. All available historical shoreline years (1911 – 2005) are included in the analysis of Bellows and Waimanalo Beach. The area is divided into three sections based on physical boundaries in the littoral system: North Bellows, from the north end to the jetties at Waimanalo Stream mouth; Central Bellows, from Waimanalo Stream to Inaole Steam; and South Bellows and Waimanalo Beach, from Inaole Stream to Kaiona Beach Park. For ST, IC identifies the null model (0 m/yr) as the best model for all three beach sections.\\n\\nIn the North Bellows section, IC identifies EXT as the best model. EXT finds erosion in the northern half of the section, with a maximum erosion rate of -0.70 ± 0.17 m/yr at the northern end and accretion in the southern half, with a maximum accretion rate of 0.60 ± 0.15 m/yr near the southern end. The shoreline change rate is -0.19 ± 0.13 m/yr (erosion) averaged along the entire section.\\n\\nIn the Central Bellows section, IC identifies EXT as the best model. EXT finds erosion in the northern half of the section with a maximum erosion rate of -0.59 ± 0.10 m/yr at the northern end and accretion in the southern half with a maximum accretion rate of 0.26 ± 0.11 m/yr. The shoreline change rate is -0.11 ± 0.11 m/yr (erosion) averaged along the entire section.\\n---\\n## In the South Bellows and Waimanalo section\\n\\nIC identifies LXT as the best model. LXT finds accretion from Inaole Stream to Bellows Field Beach Park, erosion near the northern end of Waimanalo, and accretion along the rest of the beach fronting Waimanalo, except for a small area of erosion near the southern end of Waimanalo. The maximum erosion rate of -0.70 ±0.11 is found in northern Waimanalo. The maximum accretion rate of 0.66 ±0.10 is found in front of Waimanalo Bay Beach Park. The shoreline change rate is 0.10 ± 0.09 m/yr (accretion) averaged along the entire beach.\\n\\n|Central North Bellows Beach|Shoreline Change Rates, m/yr; 1911-2005|\\n|---|---|\\n|S-T|EXT|\\n\\nFigure 5.

IC provides a statistical means of finding the most parsimonious model to describe historical shoreline change at a beach. Genz, et al. (in press) shows the PXT shoreline change models (with acceleration in the change rate with time) often over-estimate future shoreline positions in synthetic shoreline data sets. The specific goals of an agency’s coastal management plan may influence planners to choose another of the parsimonious PX or PXT models for projecting future shoreline hazards. Or, several models may be utilized to forecast a range of possible shoreline positions. The credibility of erosion hazard forecasts is increased if different shoreline change models agree in their prediction.\\n\\nFor all four southeast Oahu study areas, EXT has the lowest IC score and is identified as the best model. The basis functions used in calculating the EX and EXT models (principal components, Eigen vectors) are derived directly from the shoreline data. In all other methods a polynomial is fit to the change model. It is not surprising then that the EX and EXT methods often require fewer parameters and produce lower residual errors in fitting a model (and low IC score). Whether the EX and EXT methods actually produce the best models is an area of ongoing research. Principle components provide the exciting prospect of describing the unknown physics driving change at a beach.\\n\\nBeaches may not erode or accrete in a constant (linear) manner. In a well-configured shoreline data set (many shorelines, low uncertainty), PXT shoreline change models can detect acceleration in the shoreline change rate with time. In this case, the PXT models can provide a better depiction of how a shoreline is changing at present and how change itself has changed with time. Time series of historical shorelines in this study span less than 100 years. It is not unreasonable to wonder if the PXT models may be capturing decadal-scale fluctuations (e.g., ENSO, tradewind oscillations) in shoreline position at some beaches. Correlating shoreline change with these atmospheric fluctuations would be an exciting advance for coastal studies. However, it may discourage coastal managers from using PXT models for long-term erosion hazard planning. The greatest potential for the PXT method is the ability to detect accelerating shoreline change that should be expected with accelerating sea-level rise from global temperature increase (Church and White 2006). Continued studies with the addition of new shoreline data in the future will help to answer these questions.\\n\\n## CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nShoreline change rates are calculated from historical shoreline positions to better understand trends of erosion and accretion and to project future shoreline positions. Erosion hazard predictions may be used by coastal managers to design shoreline development policies that will better protect public and private coastal resources. It is vital that shoreline change studies provide significant and defensible results if the data is to be used for the development of public policy.\\n---\\nThe new PX and PXT shoreline change rate calculation methods are shown to provide more significant and defensible shoreline change rates than the previously used ST method for beaches of southeast Oahu. The PX and PXT methods produce statistically significant rates for up to 89% of shoreline transects versus 42% of transects using the ST method. For Kailua and Lanikai ST produces rates very similar to the PX models. However, the uncertainties of PX models are significantly lower than ST for these beaches. Using the ST method to analyze South Kailua, Bellows, and Waimanalo beaches, IC picks the null model (0 m/yr) as the best change model for this method. The null model indicates that there was no significant shoreline change or that the shoreline positional uncertainty was too high for the method to reliably fit a model to the shoreline data. PX and PXT are able to find significant rates at these beaches by utilizing shoreline data from all transects on a beach in calculating the change model. PXT models provide new insight on shoreline change in southeast Oahu as they reveal changing rates through time.\\n\\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n\\nFunding for this study was made available by State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, City and County of Honolulu, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Harold K.L.

Historical shoreline change, southeast Oahu, Hawaii; applying polynomial models to calculate shoreline change rates. Journal of Coastal Research, 25(6), 1236–1253. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Here we present shoreline change rates for the beaches of southeast Oahu, Hawaii, calculated using recently developed polynomial methods to assist coastal managers in planning for erosion hazards and to provide an example for interpreting results from these new rate calculation methods. The polynomial methods use data from all transects (shoreline measurement locations) on a beach to calculate a rate at any one location along the beach. These methods utilize a polynomial to model alongshore variation in the rates. Models that are linear in time best characterize the trend of the entire time series of historical shorelines. Models that include acceleration (both increasing and decreasing) in their rates provide additional information about shoreline trends and indicate how rates vary with time. The ability to detect accelerating shoreline change is an important advance because beaches may not erode or accrete in a constant (linear) manner. Because they use all the data from a beach, polynomial models calculate rates with reduced uncertainty compared with the previously used single-transect method. An information criterion, a type of model optimization equation, identifies the best shoreline change model for a beach. Polynomial models that use eigenvectors as their basis functions are most often identified as the best shoreline change models.\\n\\nADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: Coastal erosion, shoreline change, erosion rate, polynomial, PX, PXT, EX, EXT, ST, single-transect, information criterion, Hawaii.\\n\\n### INTRODUCTION\\n\\nTourism is Hawaii’s leading employer and its largest source of revenue. Island beaches are a primary attraction for visitors, and some of the most valuable property in the world occurs on island shores. Beaches are also central to the culture and recreation of the local population. During recent decades many beaches on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, have narrowed or been completely lost to erosion (Fletcher et al., 1997; Hwang, 1981; Sea Engineering, 1988), threatening business, property, and the island’s unique lifestyle. Results from a Maui Shoreline Study (Fletcher et al., 2003) resulted in the first erosion rate-based coastal building setback law in the state of Hawaii (Norcross-Nu’u and Abbott, 2005). Concerns about the condition of Oahu’s beaches prompted federal, state, and county government agencies to sponsor a similar study of shoreline change for the island of Oahu. The primary goals of the Oahu Shoreline Study are to analyze trends of historical shoreline change, identify future coastal erosion hazards, and report results to the scientific and management community. It is vital that coastal scientists produce reliable, i.e., statistically significant and defensible, erosion rates and hazard predictions if results from shoreline change studies are to continue to influence public policy. To further this goal, Frazer et al. (2009) and Genz et al. (2009) have developed polynomial methods for calculating shoreline change rates. The new methods may calculate rates that are constant in time or rates that vary with time (acceleration, both increasing and decreasing). The polynomial models without rate acceleration are generally referred to as PX models (for polynomials in the alongshore dimension, X) and the models with rate acceleration are PXT (polynomials in X and time). The PX methods, with a linear fit in time, best characterize the trend of the whole time series of historical shorelines and, therefore, describe the long-term change at a beach. The PXT methods may provide additional information about recent change at a beach and can show how rates may have varied with time. These methods are shown here and in the Frazer et al. and Genz et al. papers (2009) to produce statistically significant shoreline change rates more often than the commonly used single-transect (ST) method using the same data.\\n\\nDOI: 10.2112/08-1070.1 received 1 May 2008; accepted in revision 27 October 2008.\\n---\\n## Southeast Oahu Shoreline Study\\n\\nHere we employ the polynomial methods to calculate shoreline change rates for the beaches of southeast Oahu. The rates are prone to high variability related to stream flow, and this is not accounted for in our uncertainty analysis.\\n\\n### PHYSICAL SETTING\\n\\nThe study area consists of the northeast-facing beaches along the southeast coast of Oahu, Hawaii. The area is bounded to the north and south, respectively, by basalt Mokapu and Makapuu points (Figure 1). This shoreline is fronted by a broad fringing reef platform extending 1 to 3.5 km from the shoreline except in the far south. The reef crest shallows to 5 to 0 m depth, 0.3 to 1.0 km from shore, along 70% of the study area. This fringing reef protects most beaches from the full energy of open-ocean waves (Bochicchio et al., 2009).\\n\\nThe beaches in the study area face predominantly toward the northeast. The study area is exposed to trade wind swell from the northeast (typically 1–3 m with 6- to 8-second period) throughout the year (Bodge and Sullivan, 1999). Trade winds are most common during the summer (April to September, 80% of the time) and are less persistent, though still dominant, in winter. Moderately high to very high energy refracted long period swells from the north (typically 1–5 m with 12- to 20-second period) impinge in winter. Significant offshore wave heights of 8 m recur annually (Vitousek and Fletcher, 2008). The fraction of open-ocean wave energy reaching the inner reef and shoreline varies throughout the study area and is controlled by refraction and shoaling of waves on the complex bathymetry of the fringing reef.\\n\\nThe study area contains four beach study sections, which are additionally subdivided into 14 segments by natural and anthropogenic barriers to sediment transport and/or gaps in reliable shoreline data.\\n\\n### Kailua Beach\\n\\nKailua Beach is a 3.5-km crescent-shaped beach bounded to the north by limestone Kapoho Point and to the south by basalt Alala Point. Between Mokapu Point and Kapoho Point is primarily hard limestone and basalt shoreline (no beach). A sinuous 200 m wide sand-floored channel bisects the reef platform. The channel widens toward the shore into a broad sand field at the center of Kailua Beach. The inner shelf and shoreline are protected from large, long period swell by the fringing reef. Wave heights become progressively smaller toward the southern end of Kailua Beach because shallow reef crest and Popoia Island refract and dissipate more of the open ocean swell.\\n\\nThe residential area of Kailua is built on a broad plain of Holocene-age carbonate dune ridges and terrestrial lagoon deposits. Low vegetated dunes front many of the homes on Kailua Beach. Kaelepulu Stream empties at Kailua Beach Park at the southern end of Kailua Beach.\\n\\nFor shoreline change analysis, Kailua Beach is divided into two study segments with a boundary at the Kaelepulu stream mouth. The boundary is required because of a gap in reliable shoreline data at the stream mouth. Shoreline positions from the stream mouth are not considered reliable because they\\n\\n### Lanikai Beach\\n\\nThe Lanikai shoreline is a slightly embayed 2 km wide headland between the basalt outcrops of Alala Point and Wailea Point. Lanikai Beach is a narrow 800 m long stretch of sand in the north-central portion of the Lanikai shoreline. The remainder of Lanikai has no beach at high tide, except for a small pocket of sand stabilized by a jetty in the far south. Waves break against seawalls in areas without beach.\\n\\nThe fringing reef fronting Lanikai is shallower than the reef fronting the adjacent areas of Kailua and Waimanalo. The shallow reef platform extends 2 km offshore to the Mokulua Islands. Wave heights along the Lanikai shoreline are typically small (≤ 1 m) because of refraction and breaking of open-ocean waves on the shallow fringing reef and shores of the offshore Mokulua Islands. The community of Lanikai is built on the foot of the basalt Keolu Hills and on a narrow coastal plain composed of carbonate sands and terrigenous alluvium.\\n\\n### Bellows and Waimanalo Beach\\n\\nBellows and Waimanalo Beach is a nearly continuous 6.5 km long beach extending from near Wailea Point to southern Waimanalo. In the northern end of the Bellows shoreline (from Wailea Point 700 m to the south), waves break against a stone revetment at high tide. The beach was lost to erosion in the northern portion by 1996. The beach is partially interrupted at two other locations by stone jetties at Waimanalo Stream and remains of a similar structure at Inaole Stream.\\n\\nA broad reef platform extends to a shallow reef crest 1.5–0.5 km offshore. Paleochannels, karst features, and several large depressions on the reef platform contain significant sand deposits and likely play an important role in storage and movement of beach sand. Bellows Field and the town of Waimanalo are built on a broad plain of carbonate and alluvial sediments.\\n\\n### Kaupo and Makapuu Beaches\\n\\nBetween southern Waimanalo and Makapuu beaches are a series of narrow pocket beaches separated by natural and anthropogenic hard shoreline, which divide this study section into eight beach segments for shoreline change analysis. The broad carbonate coastal plain found to the north is absent from most of this section. The steep basalt Koolau cliffs rise within a few hundred meters behind the shoreline. Beaches in the northern two-thirds of the study section are generally narrow (5–20 m). Seawalls front homes along the northern portion of Kaupo Beach. To the south the beaches are backed by a low rock scarp (1–2 m) or by man-made revetments.\\n---\\n## Figure 1.

The fringing reef disappears offshore of Makapuu Beach allowing the full brunt of easterly trade wind waves and refracted northerly swells to reach the shoreline there. Makapuu Beach, popular with bodysurfers, is well known for its large shore-breaking waves. Makapuu Beach is wide (50 m) and sediment-rich compared with beaches to the north. The back-beach area is characterized by vegetated dunes sloping against the base of the Koolau cliffs. A sand-filled channel extends offshore.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 25, No. 6, 2009\\n---\\n## Southeast Oahu Shoreline Study\\n\\nPREVIOUS WORK\\n1239\\nHwang (1981) was the first to compile historical shoreline change for beaches of Oahu. His study utilized a vegetation line and a waterline as the shoreline proxies. Historical shoreline positions were measured from aerial photographs along shore-perpendicular transects roughly every 1000 ft (328 m). His study reported position changes of the vegetation line from one aerial photo to another and from these the net change in the vegetation line and waterline through the time span of the study. Annual rates were not calculated from the data. Movement of the vegetation line at Kailua Beach indicated long-term (net) accretion along the whole length of the beach. Historical shorelines at Kailua Beach Park indicated erosion between 1971 and 1978. Long-term accretion was found at most transects at Lanikai Beach, except at the north and south ends. Erosion was also noted at north and south Lanikai for the more recent years of historical shorelines (the beach has since disappeared in these areas). Most transects at Bellows and Waimanalo beaches indicated erosion over the long term. Hwang reports the beach was effectively lost (submerged at high tide) at north Bellows Beach by 1980.\\n\\nSea Engineering (1988) produced an update to the Hwang (1981) study with a more recent aerial photo set, while using the same methods and transects. More recent aerial photographs (1988) indicated that long-term accretion continued at all transects at Kailua Beach. Erosion slowed or turned to accretion at Kailua Beach Park from 1980 to 1988. Their study reported extensive areas of erosion and beach loss at north and south Lanikai between 1980 and 1988. However, this erosion was not apparent in their shoreline change measurements because the vegetation line was effectively fixed at the seawalls now fronting homes along the eroded portions of the Lanikai shoreline.\\n\\nNorcross, Fletcher, and Merrifield (2002) calculated annual shoreline change rates and interannual beach volume change at Kailua Beach. They used orthorectified aerial photographs and NOAA topographic maps (T-sheets) to map a low water mark as a shoreline proxy. Annual shoreline change rates were calculated using the ST method. Interannual beach volume changes were calculated using data from beach profile surveys. The study concluded that Kailua Beach experienced annual shoreline accretion from 1926–1996 and recent (prior to 1996) net increase in beach sand volume.\\n\\nOur study provides an important update and comparison to the results of previous studies. We aim to improve on all of the previous studies by utilizing improved photogrammetric methods for measuring historical shoreline positions and statistical methods for calculating shoreline change rates. In addition, a modern aerial photograph set (2005) provides more recent shoreline positions for our study beaches.\\n\\n### METHODS\\n\\nMapping Historical Shorelines\\n\\nFor this study we adhere closely to the methods of Fletcher et al. (2003) for mapping historical shorelines on Maui, Hawaii. Historical shorelines are digitized from NOAA NOS topographic maps (T-sheets) and 0.5-m spatial resolution (pixel) orthorectified aerial photo mosaics. Only large-scale (typically 0.5 m scanned pixel resolution, media-dependent), vertical, survey-quality air photos with sufficient tonal and color contrast to delineate a high-resolution shoreline proxy were chosen for this study. Orthorectification and mosaicking was performed using PCI Geomatics’ Geomatica Orthoengine software (2007) to reduce displacements caused by lens distortion, Earth curvature, refraction, camera tilt, radial distortion, and terrain relief. The orthorectification process typically resulted in root mean square (RMS) positional errors of 2 m based on the misfit of the orthorectification model to a master orthorectified image and a digital elevation model (DEM).\\n\\nNew aerial photography of study beaches was acquired in late 2005. Aircraft position (global positioning system locations) and orientation data (e.g., altitude, pitch, roll, and yaw) were recorded by an on-board positional orientation system (POS). The recent images are orthorectified and mosaicked in PCI using polynomial models incorporating POS data and high-resolution (5-m horizontal, submeter vertical) DEMs. The orthorectified 2005 photo mosaics serve as master images for the orthorectification of older aerial photographs.\\n\\nT-sheets are georeferenced using polynomial mathematical models in PCI with RMS errors 4 m. Rectification of T-sheets is also verified by overlaying them on orthophoto mosaics to examine their fit to rocky shorelines and other unchanged geological features also visible in the modern photography. T-sheet shorelines may be discarded if a satisfactory fit to a hard shoreline cannot be achieved and/or if the RMS error grossly understates the misfit. Previous workers have addressed the accuracy of T-sheets (Crowell, Leatherman, and Buckley, 1991; Daniels and Huxford, 2001; Shalowitz, 1964), finding that they meet national map accuracy standards (Ellis, 1978) and recommending them for use in shoreline change studies as a valuable source for extending the time series of historical shoreline position (National Academy of Sciences, 1990).\\n\\nThe beach toe, or base of the foreshore, is digitized from orthophoto mosaics and is a geomorphic proxy for the low water mark (LWM). The LWM is what we define as the shoreline for our change analysis. Removing or quantifying sources of uncertainty related to short-term (interannual to hourly) changes in shoreline position is necessary to achieve our goal of identifying chronic long-term trends in shoreline behavior. A LWM offers several advantages as a shoreline proxy on Hawaiian carbonate beaches, toward the goal of limiting our uncertainty. Studies from beach profile surveys have shown that a LWM is less prone to spurious position changes typical of other shoreline proxies (e.g., wet–dry line, high water mark) (Norcross, Fletcher, and Merrifield, 2002). The bright white carbonate sands typical of Hawaii beaches often hinder interpretation of water line proxies in aerial photographs—especially in older black and white images with reduced contrast and resolution. The vegetation line was used as the shoreline proxy in some previous Oahu studies (Hwang, 1981; Sea Engineering, 1988). However, on most Oahu beaches the vegetation line is cultivated and therefore often does not track the natural movement of the shoreline. Nonetheless, we create a vector of the vegetation line so that it is available to track historical changes in beach width between the vegetation line and the LWM.\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 25, No. 6, 2009\\n---\\n## Table 1.

To include the T-sheet shorelines in the time series of historical LWM shorelines, the HWM is migrated to a LWM using an offset calculated from measurements in beach profile surveys. HWM and LWM positions have been measured in beach profile surveys collected at nine locations in the study area in summer and winter for 8 years. The offset used to migrate the T-sheet HWM to a LWM is the median distance between HWM and LWM positions measured in the profiles at a beach or a nearby beach with similar littoral characteristics (e.g., wave exposure, beach morphology).\\n\\nSix to thirteen historical orthomosaics and T-sheets comprise our time series between 1911 and 2005. To determine patterns of movement, relative distances of the historical shorelines are measured from an offshore baseline along shore-perpendicular transects spaced 20 m apart (Figure 2).\\n\\n## Uncertainties in Shoreline Position\\n\\nShoreline position is highly variable on short time scales (interannual to hourly) because of tides, storms, and other natural fluctuations. Procedures for mapping historical shorelines introduce additional uncertainties. It is vital that these uncertainties be identified, rigorously calculated, and included in shoreline change models to ensure that the shoreline change rates reflect a long-term trend and are not biased because of short-term variability (noise). Building on Fletcher et al. (2003), Genz et al. (2007), and Rooney et al. (2003), we calculate seven different sources of error in digitizing historical shoreline position from aerial photographs and T-sheets.\\n\\nIdentifying the probability distribution (e.g., normal, uniform) for each error process (e.g., tidal fluctuation, seasonal variation) provides the tools to calculate the individual error uncertainty. The total positional uncertainty, Et, is the root sum of squares of the individual errors. We assume Et follows a normal distribution because the Central Limits Theorem states that the sum of many sources of uncertainty tends toward a normal distribution (Draper and Smith, 1998). Et is applied as a weight for each shoreline position when calculating shoreline change models using weighted regression methods. Total positional uncertainties for southeast Oahu historical shorelines are between 4.5 and 10.8 m (Table 1). Please note: This is the range of actual uncertainties. No historical shoreline had the highest values for all individual uncertainty sources.\\n\\nDigitizing Error, Ed. Only one analyst provides the final digitized shorelines from all orthomosaics and T-sheets to ensure consistency in the criteria used to locate each shoreline. Uncertainties in interpreting the shoreline position in aerial photographs are calculated by measuring variability in shoreline position when digitized by several experienced analysts working on a sample portion of shoreline. The digitizing error is the standard deviation of differences in shoreline position from a group of experienced operators. If an Ed value has not been calculated for a particular orthomosaic, a value from a mosaic with similar attributes (e.g., resolution, photo year) is used. Ed values range from 0.5 to 5.7 m.\\n\\nPixel Error, Ep. The resolution (pixel size) of our orthomosaics limits our ability to resolve the position of a feature (e.g., LWM) finer than 0.5 m. Therefore, Ep equals 0.5 m. T-sheets are digitally scanned at a lower resolution than aerial photographs. Ep for T-sheets is 3 m.\\n\\nSeasonal Error, Es. We do not attempt to identify and remove storm shorelines based on a priori knowledge of major storm and wave events for two reasons. One, our study (and most shoreline studies) have limited historical shoreline data (e.g., aerial photography years) and removing one or more shorelines comes at the cost of reducing an already limited data set. Two, storms tend to affect shoreline position in a nonuniform manner in an island setting. Instead, we calculate an uncertainty in shoreline position due to seasonal changes (waves and storms). To measure seasonal variability, we surveyed beach profiles summer and winter for 8 years at 33 beaches on Oahu. The seasonal change is the difference between shoreline (LWM) positions along a survey transect between summer and winter. A randomly generated uniform distribution (10,000 points) is calculated incorporating the standard deviation of the measured seasonal changes.\\n---\\n## Southeast Oahu Shoreline Study\\n\\nform distribution is an adequate approximation of the annual probability of shoreline positions resulting from seasonal fluctuations because an aerial photo has equal probability of being taken at any time of year. The seasonal error, Es, is the standard deviation of this randomly generated distribution. For beaches without profile data, an Es value from a nearby beach with similar littoral characteristics is used. Es values range from 3.6 to 6.2 m.\\n\\nRectification Error, Er. Aerial photographs are orthorectified to reduce displacements caused by lens distortion, Earth curvature, camera tilt, and terrain relief using PCI Orthoengine software. The software calculates an RMS error from the misfit of the orthorectification model to the master orthorectified image and DEM. Er values range from 0.6 to 3.0 m for orthophoto mosaics. T-sheets are georeferenced in PCI Orthoengine using polynomial models. Er for T-sheets ranges from 1.4 to 2.9 m.\\n\\nTidal Fluctuation Error, Etd (aerial photographs, only). Aerial photographs are obtained without regard to tidal cycles, and the time of day each photo is collected is typically unknown, resulting in inaccuracies in digitized shoreline position from tidal fluctuations. Rather than attempting to correct the shoreline position, the possible fluctuations due to tides are included as an uncertainty. Hawaii is situated in a microtidal zone of the Pacific Ocean with maximum tidal fluctuations of 1 m. Therefore, tides have less of an effect on shoreline position at Hawaii beaches than at most beaches on the continental United States, where tides typically vary by several meters. Surveys of the horizontal movement of LWMs (beach toe) between a spring low and high tide at three beaches in the study area found that the beach toe migrated horizontally landward 8 to 12 m from low to high tide. The probability of an aerial photograph being taken at low or high tide is assumed to be equal. Thus, a uniform distribution is a conservative estimate of the probability distribution of LWM positions due to tidal fluctuation in an aerial photograph. Etd is the standard deviation of a randomly generated uniform distribution derived from the standard deviation of the surveyed tidal fluctuations. Etd values range from 2.5 to 3.4 m for this study.\\n\\nT-Sheet Plotting Error, Ets (T-sheets only). Surveyors working on T-sheets mapped the high water mark (HWM) as a proxy for shoreline position. The T-sheet plotting error is based on Shalowitz’s (1964) analysis of topographic surveys. He identifies three major errors in the accuracy of these surveys: (1) measuring distances, 1 m; (2) plane table position, 3 m; and (3) delineation of the high water line, 4 m. The total plotting error, Ets, for all T-sheets is the root sum of squares of the three distinct errors, 5.1 m.\\n\\nConversion Error for T-Sheets, Etc (T-sheets only). To compare historical shorelines from T-sheets and aerial photographs, we migrated the surveyed HWM from a T-sheet to a LWM position using data from beach topographic profile surveys. The offset used to migrate the T-sheet HWM to a LWM is the median distance between HWM and LWM positions measured in surveys at a beach. The uncertainty in this conversion, Etc, is the standard deviation of the distances between surveyed HWM and LWM positions. For beaches without profiles, the offset and Etc value from a similar nearby\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 25, No. 6, 2009\\n---\\n## Polynomial Methods\\n\\nHere we provide a summary of the recently developed polynomial methods to assist the reader in interpreting the results and conclusions in this study. Please refer to Frazer et al. (2009) and Genz et al. (2009) for more detailed information on these rate calculation methods.\\n\\nThe ST method calculates a rate at each transect by fitting a linear trend to shoreline positions plotted in distance along a transect and time. Shoreline change rates vary independently along the shore (from transect to transect) with the ST method. Polynomials can be used to model this variation in shoreline change rates in the alongshore direction. By modeling shoreline data in the alongshore direction as well, we can incorporate shoreline positions from all transects on a beach in a single model. The single model will invariably require fewer mathematical parameters to calculate change rates at each transect than the ST method, leading to more parsimonious models (reducing overfitting). In addition, a single polynomial model correctly assumes that the shoreline data from adjacent transects is related (e.g., dependent).\\n\\nFigure 4. PX (EX) shoreline change model for North Bellows Beach. Rates (slope) vary continuously in the alongshore direction but are constant (linear) in time (no acceleration).\\n\\nOn an actual continuous beach, the positions of each transect share sand with adjacent positions along the shore. Thus, the shoreline positions and shoreline change rates at each transect on a beach are related. Shoreline transects need to be closely spaced to effectively characterize shoreline change along a beach. We use a 20-m transect spacing for easy comparison of our methods and results with other recent studies.\\n\\nThe rates calculated using the ST method tend to have high uncertainty because ST is modeling shoreline change independently at each transect. High rate uncertainty can result in rates at many transects that are not statistically significant. For this study we consider a rate to be insignificant if it is indistinguishable from a rate of 0 m/yr (i.e., rate uncertainty overlaps 0 m/yr). If we can reduce the uncertainty in shoreline change rates, we will aid coastal managers in making better-informed decisions in planning for future erosion hazards.\\n\\nThe polynomial methods allow detection of rate variations (acceleration in time), in addition to modeling rate variations spatially alongshore. Detecting acceleration in the rates is easier with these methods because of the reduced number of parameters in the model compared with ST. The uncertainties with the rates calculated using the polynomial methods are invariably lower than with the ST method because they use all of the data on a beach to calculate the rates. Thus, the basis function methods produce statistically significant rates at a higher percentage of transects than ST.\\n\\nThe polynomial methods use one of three types of basis functions, combined in a finite linear combination, to build a model for the alongshore variation of rates. All of the methods use generalized least squares regression (GLS) to calculate the parameters of the model. GLS incorporates the uncertainty (E t) of each shoreline position in weighting each shoreline’s influence on the model. LXT uses Legendre polynomials as the basis functions. RXT utilizes trigonometric functions (e.g., sines and cosines) as the basis functions. EXT, also known as ‘‘eigenbeaches’’ utilizes eigenvectors (i.e., principal components) of the shoreline data as the basis functions. The eigenvectors are calculated from the shoreline data using all transects on a beach.\\n\\nModels that do not include acceleration in their rates are referred to as LX, RX, and EX, respectively. Generally, we refer to these as PX models (Figure 4). The rates from PX models are constant in time but vary continuously in the alongshore direction. The rates from the LXT, RXT, and EXT models vary continuously with time as well as in the alongshore dimension, and we refer to these models generally as PXT models (Figure 5). A PXT model that does not identify acceleration in the rate with time.\\n\\nFigure 5. PXT (EXT, includes acceleration in the rate with time) shoreline change model for North Bellows Beach.

In addition, results from the ST model are used in estimating the spatial (alongshore) correlation of the noise for the polynomial models. A decaying exponential function is fit to the autocorrelation of the ST data residuals. The best-fit exponential decay function is incorporated in the alongshore polynomial model to represent decreasing dependence of the shoreline data with distance from each transect.\\n\\nWith the Matlab codes developed by Frazer et al. (2009) and Genz et al. (2009), many possible models are calculated for the three basis function model types, with and without acceleration in the rates (LXT, RXT, EXT, LX, RX, EX). The models vary in the number (parameters) of basis functions of each type used in linear combination.\\n\\nAn information criterion (IC) is used to compare the parsimony of the various models. We use a version of Akaike information criterion (AICu) (Burnham and Anderson, 2002; Frazer et al., 2009; Genz et al., 2009). In general, an IC is a comparative statistic or score based on the residual errors of the model (i.e., ‘goodness of fit’) and the number of mathematical parameters used in the model. As a measure of parsimony or, more accurately, the lack of it, the IC score is increased for models with a greater number of model parameters and reduced for improved fit to the data. The model with the lowest IC score is the most parsimonious model and is the best model to describe shoreline change at a beach. A model with a rate of 0 m/yr (showing no change) is also given an IC score for comparison with the models with rates.\\n\\nThe IC scores are used to select the best model within each of the six polynomial model types (LXT, RXT, EXT, LX, RX, EX). The ST model and its IC score are calculated for comparison with the polynomial models. The polynomial models invariably produce results with lower IC scores than ST.\\n\\nWe attempt to provide the best information about long-term and more recent shoreline change occurring at a beach to help shoreline managers in planning for future erosion.\\n\\n### RESULTS\\n\\nHistorical Shoreline Change\\n\\nKailua Beach\\n\\nThe EX shoreline change model has the lowest IC score among the PX (nonaccelerated) models at both beach study segments at Kailua Beach (separated by Kaelepulu Stream). The EX method calculates erosion rates similar to those of the ST method, indicating long-term accretion throughout most of Kailua Beach. However, the average rate uncertainty is reduced with the EX model compared with the ST model (0.1 m/yr vs. 0.2 m/yr, respectively) (Table 2), resulting in a greater percentage of transects that have significant rates with the EX model.\\n\\nIn the segment south of Kaelepulu Stream, the EX model shows no long-term change, in contrast to results from the\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 25, No. 6, 2009\\n---\\n## Figure 6.

The selection of an EX model (based on IC scores) that shows no significant change may be interpreted two ways. One, the historical shorelines data for this portion of beach is too highly variable (noisy) to calculate a statistically significant long-term trend. Or, two, this segment of beach is stable in the long term, and any erosion or accretion is episodic within the time frame of the study. The ST method (which always produces a model with rates) has higher rate uncertainties in this segment, further suggesting a highly variable data set.

EX measures long-term accretion at all transects at Lanikai Beach, except for a small area of erosion at the northern end of the beach. EX calculates the highest accretion rates (up to 0.8 0.1 m/yr) aligned with the middle of the accretion point in the north central portion of the beach.\\n\\nThe EXT model has the lowest IC score among the PXT models at Lanikai Beach. Similar to EX, the EXT model calculates the highest accretion rates (up to 1.6 0.2 m/yr) at the center of the accretion point in north central Lanikai Beach. The EXT model indicates accelerating erosion at the north end of Lanikai Beach. Based on the EXT model, the central portion of Lanikai Beach began undergoing accelerating accretion prior to 1949 (Figure 10). The EXT model at the southernmost transects indicates that accretion is slowing in this area and may be turning to accelerating erosion.\\n\\n### Lanikai\\n\\nAt Lanikai, 1229 m of beach were lost to erosion in the time span of this study (306 m at north Lanikai, 923 m at south Lanikai) (Figures 9a–9c). Present-day Lanikai Beach is bounded on both ends by extensive seawalls constructed in areas where the beach has been lost to erosion. Aerial photographs show the beach at north Lanikai was completely lost to erosion between 1975 and 1982 and has not returned. At south Lanikai, the shoreline advanced seaward between 1949 and 1975 forming an accretion point similar in size to the accretion point presently growing in the north-central portion of Lanikai Beach. Accretion ended and erosion took over in the late 1970s and much of the beach was lost by 1989. We calculate shoreline change rates only for the remaining portion of Lanikai Beach.\\n\\n### Bellows and Waimanalo Beaches\\n\\nAt north Bellows (Figure 11), the northern end (690 m) of the beach was lost to erosion prior to 1996. Waves break against a stone revetment at high tide in this area.

However, the PX models result in a higher per-\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 25, No. 6, 2009\\n---\\n## Southeast Oahu Shoreline Study\\n\\nsubject to episodic erosion even if the beach is relatively stable over the long term (as modeled by ST and LX).\\n\\nTransect #33\\nEX = 0.8    0.1 myr\\n50       EXT _ 1.6    0.2 myr\\n\\nThe EXT models indicate recent accelerating erosion at 43% of transects and recent decelerating accretion at 14% of transects. Thus, the EXT models indicate deteriorating fitness of the littoral sediment budget at 57% of transects at Bellows and Waimanalo beaches. The areas of deteriorating fitness are in the northern portion of each of the three beach study segments, whereas the areas of improving fitness (43% of transects) are in the south of each study segment.\\n\\nKaupo and Makapuu Beaches\\n\\n1920 1940 1960                       980 2000\\n\\nAt Kaupo and Makapuu beaches the ST models and PX find a similar alongshore pattern of shoreline change for all beaches, except at Kaupo Beach Park (Figures 14a–14c). Other than at Kaupo Beach Park, the ST and PX models with the lowest IC scores estimate erosion rates under 0.3 m/yr or find no significant change. The rate uncertainty is improved with PX models compared with ST models, resulting in significant rates at a greater percentage of transects. The PXT models with the lowest IC scores detect recent accretion or find no significant change at all beaches, except Kaupo Beach Park.\\n\\nAt Kaupo Beach Park the RX model has the lowest IC score among the PX models. Here, the RX model finds long-term erosion (up to 1.7          0.2 m/yr) at the southern end of the beach and long-term accretion at the northern end of the beach (up to 1.2       0.1 m/yr). The LXT model, with the lowest IC score among the PXT models, indicates a pattern of shoreline change rates at this beach that is similar to the results of the RX model, with erosion in the south and accretion in the north. However, the results of the RX and LXT models do not agree with the results of the ST, EX, nor EXT models at Kaupo Beach Park, bringing into question the validity of the RX and LXT models at this beach. Nonetheless, the results of the RX and LXT models here point out that Kaupo Beach Park should be monitored closely for future erosion hazards.\\n\\nAt Makapuu Beach the PX and PXT models indicating no significant change (rates         0 m/yr) have the lowest IC scores. The LX model (0 m/yr) has the lowest IC score among the PX models. The LXT model reverts to the LX model (0 m/yr and finds no acceleration) and has the lowest IC score among the PXT models. The ST model rates at Makapuu are statistically insignificant at all transects. Examination of the historical shorelines shows high variability in their position throughout the time span of the study (Figure 15). High seasonal variability is also recorded in beach profile surveys at Makapuu Beach. A lack of available shoreline data (six historical shorelines) for Makapuu may also be limiting our ability to calculate a long-term trend.\\n\\n## DISCUSSION\\n\\nThe EX model has the lowest IC score among the PX models in eight of fourteen beach segments in this study. The EXT model has the lowest IC score among the PXT models in 11 of 14 beach segments.

However, the specific goals of an agency’s coastal management plan may influence planners to choose another of the parsimonious PX or PXT models for erosion hazard planning. It is important that coastal scientists and coastal managers are clear on what question is being asked regarding shoreline change at a beach before reporting shoreline change results. Are we interested in long-term change or more recent change? Are we looking for the worst-case scenario or the most likely scenario? For example, an agency may determine that the most conservative or safest course is to select the model that calculates the highest erosion rates and predicts the greatest erosion hazard. Or, coastal planners may use results from several shoreline change rate calculation methods to present a range of possible future shoreline change scenarios. Ultimately, the credibility of erosion rates and erosion hazard forecasts is improved if the results from various shoreline change rate calculation methods agree.\\n\\nTime series of historical shorelines in this study span nearly 100 years. As discussed previously, the recent trend in PXT models often illustrates an erosion or accretion trend of the most recent shorelines (50 years). Littoral processes along most Hawaiian beaches are driven primarily by waves from frequent easterly trade winds and powerful seasonal swells (Vitousek and Fletcher, 2008). It is possible that some PXT models are detecting shorter-term (e.g., decadal) fluctuations in shoreline position, as opposed to chronic, i.e., long-term, shoreline change. An example of this may be the most recent episode of accelerated erosion as modeled by PXT at Kailua Beach Park. There we see at least one other prior episode of erosion and accretion in the movement of the historical shoreline positions. The PXT models (and the PX models) cannot identify multiple erosion and accretion events in a data set. Doing so would require fitting more complex models (e.g., a sinusoid) to a limited shoreline data set, leading to overfitting of the data. In addition, the PXT models are limited by their inability to model the inevitable deceleration that should follow any period of accelerated shoreline change, such as seen at Kailua Beach Park. Theoretically, a rate that continues to accelerate into the future will eventually become unrealistically high. Therefore, the PXT models may not be appropriate for forecasting future shoreline positions in the long term (e.g., 50 years) at most beaches.\\n\\nBecause the PXT methods can detect acceleration, these methods have the prospect of detecting accelerating shoreline change that should be expected with accelerating sea-level rise from global temperature increase (Church and White, 2006). We will attempt to investigate shoreline change due to sea-level rise in our continued studies of all the beaches in the Hawaiian Islands with the PX and PXT methods. Thus far, it appears shoreline change at Hawaii beaches is dominated by the dynamics of the local littoral sediment budget. If Hawaii beaches are changing because of sea-level rise, it appears difficult, at present, to detect this change signal in the background of typically noisy historical shoreline data.\\n\\n### CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nThe EX and EXT methods are the preferred methods for calculating shoreline change rates from historical shoreline\\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Vol. 25, No. 6, 2009\\n---\\n## Southeast Oahu Shoreline Study\\n\\n|Shoreline Change Rates for Kaupo and Makapuu Beaches|Rate|Unc|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|290|280|270|260|250|231|221|210|200|180|170|\\n\\nFigure 14.

Improved confidence in results from shoreline change studies will help shoreline managers to make better-informed decisions to protect against future erosion hazards.\\n\\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nFunding for this study was made available by U.S. Geological Survey National Shoreline Assessment Project, State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, City and Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 25, No. 6, 2009\\n---\\n## Southeast Oahu Shoreline Study\\n\\nMorton, R.A.; Miller, T.A., and Moore, L.J., 2004.

The dramatic degradation of sandy beaches over the last several decades has become widely recognized as a serious problem in the Hawaiian Islands. A key component of Maui County\\'s beach preservation strategy is the quantification of site-specific erosion hazards. The study reported here investigates shoreline change to provide erosion hazard rates for all significant sandy shoreline on the island, which will serve as the basis for improved regulations governing siting of coastal construction. Horizontal movement of the landward and seaward boundaries of the beach from orthorectified aerial photographs and topographic surveys (T-sheets) is used to develop a multidecadal database of shoreline movement every 20 m along the coast of the island of Maui. Annual erosion hazard rates (AEHRs), calculated using a reweighted least squares regression and smoothing routine, average -0.26 m y-1. Island wide changes in beachwidth show a 26% decrease. Erosion rates on Maui\\'s north shore are double those on the western and southwestern sides of the island. Although experiencing erosion rates twice as large, beachwidths on the relatively undeveloped north shore have decreased half as much as those on the western side of the island. In-depth studies of two sites along Maui\\'s coast suggest that interannual to century scale shoreline sediment dynamics are strongly influenced by Pacific Decadal Oscillation and El Niño/Southern Oscillation related storm variability. Human impacts and other factors are likely to be important as well.\\n\\n## INTRODUCTION\\n\\nSand beaches are a common feature of many coastlines in the Hawaiian Islands. They are of vital importance to the state of Hawaii, serving as a key attraction for the visitor industry, which provides more that 60% of all jobs and brings in several times more income than from all other sources combined. Their prevalence is perhaps part of the reason why they have not been widely recognized as a vital resource until recently. This lack of recognition has contributed to the use of shoreline hardening as the management alternative of choice for mitigating erosion problems. Most of the 6 km of beach that has been lost on Maui is in front of coastal armoring. Recognizing the importance of their beaches, and aware of the serious loss of this resource, Maui County has taken the lead within the state in implementing measures designed to prevent further loss and sustainably manage their remaining beach resources.\\n\\nAlthough other management options such as beach renourishment may be feasible for some areas, the high and recurring costs involved and lack of identified suitable sand sources and the uncertainty of funding, at present preclude this approach in most cases (Bodge 1998, 2000). A cost-\\n\\n|1) Department of Geology, University of Hawaii, 1680 East-West Rd., Honolulu, HI. 96822, USA.|jrooney@hawaii.edu, fletcher@hawaii.edu, mbarbee@hawaii.edu, eversole@soest.hawaii.edu, siangl@hawaii.edu|\\n|---|---|\\n|2) U.S. Geological Survey, Pacific Science Center, UC Santa Cruz, 1156 High St., Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA.|brichmond@usgs.gov, agibbs@octopus.wr.usgs.gov|\\n---\\n## effective way for Maui and other counties to protect many of their beaches is with a policy of adaptation and avoidance, altering development patterns to allow natural erosion/accretion cycles to continue without interference. Such a policy requires that erosion hazard zones are identified so that human activities there may be modified to avoid future damage to the beach as well as to reduce homeowner hazard expense (Bay and Bay, 1996; Fletcher, 1998). Accordingly, the Maui Planning Department (MPD) commissioned the present study to quantify historical shoreline change and identify erosion hazard areas.\\n\\n## Physical Setting\\n\\nSandy beaches on Maui are composed of variable percentages of coralline algae, foraminifera, coral, mollusc and echinoderm fragments, with volcanic grains generally contributing a minor fraction to the total volume (Rooney, 2002). The largest reservoirs of beach sand, in Maui and other Hawaiian Islands, are typically found on the coastal plains, where they were deposited during a period of (~2 m) higher than present sea level approximately 2,000 to 4,000 years ago (Calhoun and Fletcher, 1996; Grossman and Fletcher, 1998; Harney et al., 1999). Hawaiian beaches are the exposed and eroding edge of these coastal plain deposits. Beach dynamics dominated by longshore transport characterize Hawaiian littoral systems (Calhoun et al., 2002; Eversole, 2002; Norcross et al., 2002; Rooney, 2002). Although the amount of sand released by erosion from coastal plain sediments to the beaches is relatively small compared to annual longshore sediment fluxes, it is the primary source of material for maintaining long-term sediment budgets on Hawaiian beaches (Harney et al., 1999, Rooney and Fletcher, 2000).\\n\\nHawaiian littoral sediment dynamics are largely driven by four types of seasonal waves (Figure 1). These include North Pacific swell, originating with storms in the North Pacific, generally between Kauai and Hawaii, occurring between October and April with typical significant wave heights and periods of 1.5 to 6 m and 12 to 20 seconds. Trade wind waves occur about 70% of the time, particularly in the summer months of May (Rooney et al).\\n\\nFig. 1. Directional range of seasonal waves affecting Hawaiian beaches.\\n---\\nthrough September, with heights and periods of <1 to 3 m and 6 to 8 seconds. South swell, generated by distant southern hemisphere storms, also occurs during the summer, typically with heights of <1 to 3 m and periods of 12 to 20 seconds. Kona storms occur occasionally during the winter months, generating waves 3 to 6 m high with 6 to 10 second periods, and frequently accompanied by strong winds from the southwest. Hurricane and tsunami waves occur less predictably, although the hurricane season in Hawaii is generally considered to run from about April through November.\\n\\n## METHODS\\n\\nThe primary source of historical shoreline positions is aerial photographs. Photographs are vertical, survey quality and generally of 1:12,000 or larger scale for contact prints. A series of photographs also needs to cover enough distance along the shoreline to include an adequate number of ground control points (GCPs) to ensure accurate orthorectification. Photographs meeting these criteria are available for 1949, 1960, 1963, 1975, 1987, and 1988. We contracted for a new series of photographs of the entire sandy shoreline in 1997, and for the north shore only in 2002. Photos were scanned at 500 dpi (600 dpi for black and white images) to produce the desired ground resolution of 0.3 to 0.5 m. The 2002 series has a scale of 1:19,500 but were provided in digital format at 2000 dpi thereby maintaining the same ground resolution.\\n\\n### Orthorectification\\n\\nMethods used in the study have evolved through time as new technologies have become available. In the current iteration, an orthorectified set of aerial photomosaics is obtained from commercial sources to use as base imagery. With position and orientation systems (POS) that integrate differential GPS and inertial technology, motion of aerial camera systems can be quickly and accurately compensated. This technology, in conjunction with digital elevation models (DEMs) and limited numbers of ground control points, is resulting in reasonably economical orthophotomosaics, with horizontal accuracies of 0.5 m to 2.5 m, becoming available in Hawaii. The base imagery is used to pinpoint the horizontal position and elevation of clearly identifiable natural or cultural features on the ground to be used as GCPs. The shoreline is divided into map areas typically extending between three to seven photo frames in the alongshore direction. Within a single map area, the GCPs are labeled on each photo. We use the aerial orthorectification module from PCI Geomatics, Inc. and USGS 10 m DEMs to orthorectify all the photos covering a map area. Orthorectified images are mosaicked together to produce a shore parallel orthorectified photomosaic constituting the map area.\\n\\n### Shoreline Change Reference Feature\\n\\nWe track movement of the toe of the beach to measure changes in historical shoreline position. The toe, also designated as the crest of the step or base of the foreshore, represents the approximate position of mean lower low water (MLLW) (Bauer and Allen, 1995). The toe of the beach is the preferred shoreline change reference feature for several reasons. Studies indicate that Hawaiian beaches are dominated by longshore rather than cross-shore seasonal profile changes, suggesting that the toe provides an accurate representation of the volume of sand under the profile. (Eversole, 2002; Norcross, 2002; Rooney, 2002). The high visual reflectivity of Hawaiian carbonate beaches tends to mask the visual prominence of other types of reference features such as the wet-dry line, the water line and the high-water line, especially in historical black and white aerial photos that are acquired as contact prints rather than higher resolution diapositives. A high degree of water clarity in Hawaiian waters however does allow the delineation of the beach toe during onscreen digitizing Rooney et al\\n---\\n## activities\\n\\nWe use the toe of the beach as a relatively stable natural feature that is readily obtained from historical materials and accurately reflects long-term erosional and accretional beach movement.\\n\\nThe vegetation line on the other hand is cultivated on all developed beaches and does not represent the natural movement of the shoreline. However, we define the vegetation line as the landward boundary of the beach and digitize this feature, as well as the shoreline, or seaward beach boundary. This provides the means to track both shoreline movement and beachwidth, defined as the horizontal, shore-normal distance between the two boundaries.\\n\\n## T-Sheets\\n\\nUsing aerial photos, the record of historical changes to sandy shorelines can be extended to 1949 for most of Maui. To increase the period covered by this study we also include shorelines taken from NOS topographic or hydrographic surveys (T-sheets or H-sheets). Georectified digital files of inked T-sheets and H-sheets were provided for this project by the NOAA Coastal Services Center, in scales of 1:2,500, 1:5,000, 1:10,000 and 1:20,000. Shorelines were digitized on-screen from the files provided. We test the accuracy of a T-sheet shoreline by comparing the position of erosion-resistant basalt headlands, piers and other stable features from survey shorelines against orthorectified base imagery. Although most survey shorelines are accurately located, two were rejected as unusable based on this test. Our results indicate that, except in the instances mentioned above, T-sheets we have used meet or exceed the national map accuracy standards of +10.4 m for 1:20,000 T-sheets, +8.5 m for 1:10,000 T-sheets and +3 m for 1:5,000 T-sheets.\\n\\nSurvey shorelines delineate the position of mean high water (MHW). Since we use the toe of the beach as the shoreline change reference feature, the survey shoreline must be migrated to the contemporaneous position of the toe in order to reduce the positional uncertainty of our analysis. We migrate survey shorelines landward a distance equal to the median horizontal distance between the toe and MHW from a five-year data set of semiannual beach profiles (Gibbs et al., 2002; http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/open-file/of01-308/) from twenty-seven beaches on Maui. Where shoreline movement is calculated on beaches lacking profile data, an offset is used from the nearest appropriate site experiencing similar littoral processes. In a few cases, such as along a few cobble beaches not represented in the beach profile database, the median offset of the toe and position of MHW was estimated from the earliest aerial photograph of the area. It is assumed that since the photographs used for this purpose precede the development of almost all coastal armoring, this is a reasonably reliable estimate.\\n\\n## Shoreline Change Rates\\n\\nThe position of each historical shoreline and vegetation line is measured from an arbitrarily located offshore baseline, on transects spaced approximately every 20 m along the coast. Data tables of shoreline position and date are collected for analysis at each transect and used to calculate rates of change. We calculate two types of shoreline change rate: the end-point rate (EPR) and AEHR. The EPR is a simple measure of rate of change between the earliest shoreline, usually the 1900 or 1912 T-sheet and the 1997 or 2002 shoreline vectors. The AEHR is calculated using a reweighted least squares (RLS) regression for each transect, followed by the application of a smoothing routine.\\n\\nRooney et al\\n---\\n## Considerable debate in recent years has failed to produce consensus on the best method for predicting future shoreline positions\\n\\nand the point has been made that no single method may be the best in every situation (Foster and Savage, 1989; Honeycutt et al., 2001). Linear regression has been found from multiple studies to yield overall better results than most other methods (e.g. Fenster et al., 1993; Crowell et al., 1997; Galgano et al., 1998; Honeycutt et al., 2001).\\n\\nA standard least squares (LS) regression however, is particularly susceptible to clustered data and outliers, which may completely distort the true long-term trend of shoreline behavior (Dolan et al., 1991; Fenster et al., 1993). In Hawaii, additional problems inherent in predicting erosion hazard areas include limited availability of historical data (typically 6 to 9 shorelines) and exposure to widely varying wave conditions on different sides of a single island. Because storms and tsunamis tend to impact shorelines on one side of an island at a time, not all beaches experience all events. Because Hawaiian littoral systems tend to be dominated by longshore rather than cross-shore dynamics, different areas within a single littoral cell may respond quite differently to a major wave or storm event. The temporal distribution of historical shorelines and varying responses to wave event forcing lead to considerable scatter and clustering of Hawaiian shoreline position data.\\n\\nGiven the susceptibility of the LS regression to these problems, we know that it will often yield misleading results, at least in Hawaii. A method is needed to accurately identify long-term behavior that will be minimally distorted by shoreline positions that are non-representative of the true trend. To meet this need we have adopted the RLS regression technique. This two-part method uses a least median of squares (LMS) regression, which is able to accurately identify the trend dictated by the majority of the data up to the point at which 50% of the data is outlying (Rousseeuw and Leroy, 1987). Points lying off the trend dictated by the LMS regression are given a weight of zero, while other points are given a weight of one. It is important to note that points with a weight of zero are not considered \"bad\" data. They are only identified, within the context of other shoreline positions from that same measurement transect, as being non-representative of the trend described by the majority. An LS regression is then fit to the weighted data set, allowing calculation of an accurate trend as well as the application of the wide range of statistical tests, which have been developed for this regression.\\n\\nAlthough the RLS regression correctly identifies the trend much more reliably than does an LS regression, one shortcoming is that small differences in shoreline positions from one transect to the next can result in the selection of different years of data to be included in the regression. This may produce sudden jumps in the alongshore distribution of erosion hazard rates. Alongshore smoothing of erosion rate data has been recommended as a means to minimize random variability between measurement locations (Foster and Savage, 1989; Dolan et al., 1991). It can also be utilized to reduce the measurement time interval needed to accurately determine the trend (National Academy of Sciences, 1990; Crowell et al., 1993). To minimize the variability encountered within short segments of coastline due to random variability, we apply an alongshore smoothing technique over five adjacent shoreline change measurement transects, or 100 m of shoreline. The scheme used is similar to and based on that used in Ohio to help manage coastal erosion on Lake Erie (Guy, 1999). It is a center-weighted five-point moving average, with the weighting for each group of transects being 1,3,5,3, and 1. However, approaching a rocky headland or other boundary, our scheme truncates, so that when the moving average is one transect to the left of a boundary the weights will be 1,3, 5, and 3 (Figure 2). At the transect adjacent to the boundary the weights will be 1,3, and 5.\\n---\\nThis approach appears to function well on Hawaiian shorelines, removing spikes in the erosion rates without unduly distorting them.\\n\\n|3|transect labels|888|U3|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|shoreline change|Ve ghling laclors|RLS erosion rate (or| |\\n|measurement transects| |Iranseclswilh same leller| |\\n\\nFig. 2. Alongshore smoothing procedure. Weighting factors are multiplied by the RLS erosion rate of the appropriate transect, summed, and normalized by the sum of weighting factors to determine the AEHR.\\n\\nUncertainty\\n\\nSeveral sources of uncertainty impact the accuracy of historical shoreline positions and shoreline change rates. Tidal uncertainty is estimated at 3.0 m, based on measurements of the maximum displacement of the beach toe at multiple locations over the course of a spring tidal cycle. The seasonal uncertainty is defined as the difference in toe position as measured in a winter 1988 aerial photograph compared to a summer 1987 aerial photograph of the same coast. These photos are available for almost all Maui study sites and a measurement is calculated for every beach in the study. Seasonal uncertainty is usually the single largest source of uncertainty, with a mean value of 8.6 m and ranging from a single extreme measurement of 20 m to a minimum of 3 m.\\n\\nMeasurement uncertainty is also estimated. For photos, it is related to the orthorectification process and onscreen delineation of the shoreline reference feature. The orthorectification software calculates root mean square (RMS) errors from measures of the misfit between points on a photo and established GCP’s, and typically ranges from 0.5 to 3 m. Digitizing errors are estimated from the mean of the absolute value of differences between multiple digitization of the same stretch of shoreline. Uncertainty estimates associated with plotting on surveys are 5 m, and with accurately picking the shoreline from aerial photos are 2 m. Error resulting from migrating survey shorelines to the toe position are estimated from the mean of the residuals of MHW to toe distances taken from the beach profile database. Values range from < 3 to almost 20 m, depending on the dynamism of the beach area under investigation. These uncertainties are random and uncorrelated and may be represented by a single measure calculated by taking the square root of the sum of their squares. The total position uncertainty for a 1:10,000 T-sheet, the most common scale on T-sheets available for the Maui coast, is typically < 10 m.\\n\\nBecause the sources of uncertainty are random, uncorrelated and unbiased across the study regions, they can be absorbed into the confidence interval calculated by the linear regression model used in determining the AEHR (Neter and Wasserman, 1974). The slope of the straight line fitted to the historical shoreline data represents a model of the long-term trend of the shoreline. The residuals, or distances that individual shorelines are separated from the line, provide a measure of the goodness\\n---\\n## RESULTS\\n\\nThere are three segments of significant sandy shoreline on Maui, separated by predominantly basalt cliffs (Figure 3). These are further divided into map areas covering an average of approximately 2 km of coastline. Each segment has a unique wave regime and suite of features characterizing the coast and hinterland.\\n\\n| |West Maui|Kihei|Kahului Harbor|Haleakala|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|North|West Maui Mountains| | | |\\n|Coast|10 km| | | |\\n\\nFig. 3.

The northern localities are exposed to heavy winter swell. Central regions experience refracted energy related to both sets of swell patterns. The West Maui shore is characterized by heavily dissected highlands with watersheds that produce large alluvial fans. Coral reefs, often dominated by calcareous algae, are found along much of this coast. Narrow, often sand depleted, beaches line the shoreline both where reefs are present as well as along open shore. The mean AEHR for West Maui is 0.22 (+/- 0.09) m y-1 and the mean EPR is 0.18 m y-1. Between 1949 and 1997 the average beach width narrowed by nearly 40 percent over this region. Approximately 3 km of beach has been completely lost in front of coastal armoring in West Maui and approximately 3 km of coastal highway is threatened by chronic erosion over the next thirty years based on the AEHR (Table 1).\\n\\n### Kihei\\n\\nThe Kihei Coast has a generally western exposure but sits in the wave shadow of Molokai, Lanai, and Kahoolawe and so only experiences significant swell energy from the south. Local seas generated by Kona storms are also a significant factor in the historical behavior of the shoreline. The Kihei Coast is characterized by relatively young highlands with watersheds that lack heavily dissected valleys. The coastal plain is a flat, sand-rich terrace that is fronted by a fringing reef in the central area only. Map areas to the north and south in the region host coral growth on the seafloor but lack a true fringing reef. Narrow, often sand depleted, beaches line the fringing reef while Rooney et al\\n---\\n## Shoreline Changes, West Maui1, Hawaii\\n\\n|Poster Area|Mean Rates (m/yr)|AEHR|Uncert|EPR|Change (%)|Beach Loss (km)|Highway Threatened (km)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Hawea & Honolua| |-0.06|0.09|-0.05|-35|0.00|0.00|\\n|Alaeloa| |-0.25|0.09|-0.22|-42|0.00|0.00|\\n|Kahana| |-0.18|0.07|-0.12|-36|0.31|0.05|\\n|Honokowai| |-0.25|0.04|-0.28|-79|0.51|0.00|\\n|North Kaanapali Beach| |-0.12|0.09|-0.08|-8|0.00|0.00|\\n|Kaanapali| |-0.32|0.13|-0.27|-29|0.00|0.00|\\n|Wahikuli| |-0.14|0.17|0.08|-64|0.06|0.02|\\n|Lahaina| |-0.43|0.07|-0.41|-51|0.68|0.52|\\n|Puamana| |-0.27|0.04|-0.23|-34|0.26|0.08|\\n|Launiupoko| |-0.22|0.05|-0.17|-30|0.56|1.01|\\n|Awalua| |-0.19|0.13|-0.05|-36|0.00|0.10|\\n|Olowalu| |-0.17|0.11|-0.02|-2|0.00|0.26|\\n|Hekili Point| |-0.15|0.07|-0.16|-44|0.42|0.47|\\n|Ukumehame & Papalaua| |-0.35|0.12|-0.30|-22|0.24|0.60|\\n|Average or (Total)| |-0.22|0.09|-0.16|-37|(3.04)|(3.11)|\\n\\n## North Shore\\n\\nThe North Shore has a generally northern exposure and receives seasonal winter North Pacific swells as well as trade wind seas. The shoreline is dominated in the west by cobble and sand beaches, in the central region by sand beaches interrupted by shoreline structures and in the east by sand beaches interspersed with rocky headlands. The North Shore region is characterized by heavy rainfall and run off from the dissected watersheds of the West Maui highlands in the northern map areas. The Kahului area features a sand-rich coastal plain and a fringing reef is found offshore of both northern and central map areas. The eastern portion of the North Shore segment is demarked by a steeper coastal plain and coastline with short pocket beaches in embayments and narrow perched beaches located on low elevation rocky terraces. The average annual erosion rate for the North Shore is 0.38 (+/- 0.13) m y-1 and the end point rate is 0.29 m y-1. Between 1949 and 1997 the average beach width on the North Shore narrowed by 12% (Table 3). Total beach loss for the North Shore is 0.81 km and approximately 0.41 km of highway is threatened by erosion hazards over the next 30 years.\\n\\n## DISCUSSION\\n\\nMethodology\\n---\\n## For the first time in the state of Hawaii, a highly detailed and accurate analysis of historical shoreline migration has been completed for all the significant sandy shoreline on an entire island.\\n\\nMethods presented above are the result of a continuing evolutionary process, responding to both changes in technology and needs of the coastal management community. The size and scope of the project made it necessary to establish a methodology of determining the rate of shoreline change that was sufficiently robust to handle the multiplicity of coastal processes and histories that characterize the Maui coast as well as maximize the information yield to resource managers. Hence, we provide two rates of change each of which has their advantages and disadvantages.

Additionally it relies upon a T-sheet shoreline that is less accurate than a photogrammetrically corrected shoreline. The AEHR utilizes a reweighted linear regression and smoothing procedure to determine the trend in shoreline change. Calculating a reweighted dataset is a robust method of minimizing inaccuracies due to short-term shoreline fluctuations. One potential problem with this method is that the AEHR frequently ignores recent accelerations in shoreline erosion and so may not fully alert coastal managers to impending beach loss nor reflect the full hazard incident to landowners. That is, there may be cases where the true erosion rate is underestimated. It is also important to acknowledge that both the EPR and AEHR methods provide a description of chronic rather than episodic erosion rates.\\n\\nIt has been suggested that by assigning some shoreline positions a weight of zero we are not using all of the data available. This is not the case. All historical shoreline positions are considered, but the trend is determined from that portion of the data that best defines a trend. For clean orderly datasets with an obvious trend, the RLS regression gives results almost identical to those from an LS regression. For shoreline positions with even a single outlier data point, which is very often the case in Hawaii, the LS regression has a marked tendency to incorrectly identify the trend of the shoreline. The RLS regression however will continue to accurately identify the trend until half the data points are no longer representative to the long-term trend of the shoreline. This procedure also effectively removes extreme shorelines that fall off trend due to storm impacts, seasonal processes and human impacts so that the effect of these uncertainties significantly altering an erosion rate is unlikely.\\n\\nOn several beaches, significant jumps in alongshore variation in erosion rate may be an artificial result of the linear regression procedure and random variation in shoreline position. To minimize these problems, an alongshore smoothing procedure, tuned to the spatial scale of Hawaiian beach dynamics, is introduced. The minor error introduced along some transects is heavily outweighed by the advantages gained in reducing spikes in erosion rates between adjacent transects that clearly do not reflect how the shoreline will move in the future.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nReasons for chronic erosion patterns are much harder to discern than the magnitude and timing of changes. However, the data described above provide researchers with important information for determining the cause of erosion in later studies. Additional studies have begun to mine these data in an effort to improve understanding of the causes of shoreline erosion on Maui. Eversole (2002) calculates the historical sediment budget for a site in the center of the West Maui coastal segment. He found that erosion over the 48 yr period of study (1949 – 1997) was mostly related to the episodic occurrence of Kona storms (early 1960’s) and Hurricane Iniki (1992). The beach (430,000 m3) experienced 220,000 m3 of gross change over the period. Of this, 62 percent was attributed to storm erosion, another 33 percent was accreted and 5 percent (a budget residual) was attributed to erosion due to relative sea-level rise. This residual erosion occurs in the form of slow but chronic shoreline recession equivalent to 73,000 m3 over the ~50 year period.\\n\\nRooney and Fletcher (2000) calculate the historical sediment budget for a 5 km segment of the north central Kihei coast. They found that between 1912 and 1949, the southern part of this area experienced erosion while the northern portion accreted. The most severe erosion occurred along the southern portion of their study site, averaging -1.8 m/y-1. In successively later years, the focus of erosion migrated almost 2 km north while the northern end of the site continued accreting. A shift Rooney et al\\n---\\nFrom net accretion to erosion across the entire area started around 1975. Low rates of net sediment transport since 1975 are primarily due to sediment impoundment by coastal armoring. They identify the combined influence of coastal armoring and a series of strong Kona storms associated with an earlier phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that transported sediment to the north, opposite the present regime, as being responsible for recent erosion trends.\\n\\nAlthough no specific research has been published regarding the causes of erosion patterns on the North Shore, local residents report that extensive run-up associated a large tsunami last century caused extensive shoreline recession. This is consistent with our observations of a large offset between the T-sheet shoreline of 1912 and the earliest photographic shoreline in 1949. The 1946 tsunami, which killed over 100 people throughout Hawaii, occurred immediately prior to the 1949 photo series and is a likely candidate for causing the observed erosion. Widespread sand mining to furnish lime for agriculture also took place for decades along the North Shore and is likely to have contributed to erosion in some areas.\\n\\nAlthough not necessarily representative of all shoreline areas, results from both of the Kihei and West Maui sites suggest that interannual to century scale shoreline sediment dynamics are strongly influenced by PDO and ENSO-related storm variability. Both Kona storm and hurricane activity is modulated by the phase of the PDO and ENSO. Konas tend to occur with greater frequency during negative phases of the PDO and La Niña periods (Rooney, 2002). Hurricane activity on the other hand increases during El Niño periods, and appears to coincide with positive PDO phases as well (Chu and Clark, 1999; Chu, 2002; Clark and Chu, 2002). Hence, shoreline change patterns may reflect periods of enhanced storminess on the decadal scale in the history of some beaches.\\n\\nHuman impacts, although also difficult to quantify, are likely to be important as well. Damaging practices such as impounding coastal plain sand with armoring and removing beach sand for lime production have been widespread along the Maui shoreline. It is unlikely that their cumulative impact is insignificant. These are especially likely to be important given the slow rate of sediment production associated with fringing reefs (Harney et al., 1999; Rooney and Fletcher, 2000). Given that largest sediment reservoirs maintaining most Hawaiian beaches lie immediately landward of them on the coastal plain, it seems appropriate to infer that sand impoundment and sand mining act to destabilize Maui beaches rendering them vulnerable to storm impacts governed by regional-scale climatic processes. We note that erosion rates on Maui\\'s north shore are about double those on the western and Kihei sides of the island. Although experiencing erosion rates twice as large, beach widths on the relatively undeveloped north shore have decreased half as much as those on the more developed and partially armored Kihei and West Maui coastlines.\\n\\nAll the main Hawaiian Islands are exposed to approximately similar storm histories. Hence, it is significant to note that Richmond et al. (2000) identify Maui as having island-wide erosion rates that exceed those on the other islands (Figure 4). On other islands the mean shoreline change rates are low and generally lie within the statistical uncertainties of the methods used. We infer from this pattern that variations in relative sea level rise (RSLR) may be a part of the reason for Maui’s greater erosion rate. Although no definitive, widely accepted relationship has yet been established between sandy shoreline behavior and RSLR, it has been proposed by numerous authors that sea level increases do lead to beach recession (c.f., Leatherman et al., 2000). Tide gauge data from Hawaii reveals that Maui is experiencing a RSLR that is ~40% greater than that on Oahu or Kauai.\\n---\\n## However, RSLR on the island of Hawaii is larger still, yet erosion rates there are significantly less than those on Maui. Explaining this contradiction remains a challenging research objective whose answer may enhance our understanding of the role of RSLR on shoreline sediment dynamics of oceanic islands.\\n\\nLegend\\n\\n1\\nIsland-wide Eusum RSLR All Islands MeanRSLRn\\n\\nFig. 4. Island wide erosion and relative sea level rise.\\n\\n## Management\\n\\nOther issues still requiring resolution include how AEHRs will be updated, and ways to take advantage of future studies that improve existing projections of erosion hazards. A statewide general permit for small-scale beach renourishment has recently become available in Hawaii. Decreases in net erosion rates resulting from this potentially valuable beach management tool need to be addressed as well. Considering the significant role of human impacts to the Maui beach environment and given the economic and natural resource value of beaches to the Maui economy, it is appropriate for the Maui Administration to continue their recent efforts to implement the most effective measures possible for managing beach resources.\\n\\n## CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nSandy beaches are a primary attraction driving the visitor industry on Maui. We document the island-wide degradation of this valuable resource with a high degree of accuracy and spatial resolution. More than a quarter of the recreationally usable beach area has eroded away over the past half century and 5.25 km of beach has been completely lost, almost all of which has been in front of seawalls and revetments protecting poorly sited buildings and infrastructure. Movement of historical shorelines and landward beach boundaries every 20 m along sandy coastlines over the past century provide the data necessary to improve the beach management regime to one based on hazard avoidance. A statistically robust method is presented to project future chronic erosion hazards while minimizing the undue influence of episodic storm and wave events. The mean island-wide AEHR and EPR are estimated to be -0.28 m y-1 ± 0.16 m y-1 and -0.19 m y-1 respectively. The mean AEHR may underestimate the erosion hazard in some areas, but suggests that over the next 30 years, an additional 4 km of highway will be threatened, with the beach currently in front of it lost as well.\\n\\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n\\nFunding for this study was made available by the U.S. Geological Survey, the Hawaii sea Grant College, the NOAA Coastal Services Center, Maui County and the Hawaii Coastal Zone Management Program.

Fletcher2\\n\\nStrong evidence on climate change underscores the need for actions to reduce the impacts of sea-level rise. Global mean sea level may rise 0.18–0.48 m by mid-century1,2 and 0.5–1.4 m by the end of the century2. Besides marine inundation, it is largely unrecognized that low-lying coastal areas may also be vulnerable to groundwater inundation, which is localized coastal-plain flooding due to a rise of the groundwater table with sea level. Measurements of the coastal groundwater elevation and tidal influence in urban Honolulu, Hawaii, allow estimates of the mean water table, which was used to assess vulnerability to groundwater inundation from sea-level rise. We find that 0.6 m of potential sea-level rise causes substantial flooding, and 1 m sea-level rise inundates 10% of a 1-km wide heavily urbanized coastal zone. The flooded area including groundwater inundation is more than twice the area of marine inundation alone. This has consequences for decision-makers, resource managers and urban planners, and may be applicable to many low-lying coastal areas, especially where groundwater withdrawal is not substantial.\\n\\n### Figure 1 | Conceptual diagram of a freshwater lens, and marine and groundwater inundation under SLR in the southern Oahu aquifer.\\n\\nCoastal regions with low elevations and dense populations are at the highest risk of marine flooding. Global estimates suggest that more than 20 million people live below normal high-tide levels and more than 200 million people are vulnerable to flooding during temporary sea-level extremes3. Areas with a higher elevated shoreline than the hinterland are somewhat protected from marine inundation; however, groundwater inundation is a further risk faced by coastal plains before marine flooding occurs (Fig. 1). The groundwater table in unconfined aquifers typically lies above mean sea level4, fluctuates with daily tides and other low-frequency sources of ocean energy, and amplitudes decrease exponentially with distance from the shoreline5. As sea level rises, the water table will rise simultaneously6 and eventually break out above the land surface creating new wetlands and expanding others, changing surface drainage, saturating the soil, and inundating the land depending on local topography. Flooding will start sporadically but will be especially intense seasonally when high tide coincides with rainfall events. Rising groundwater levels could cause long-term problems related to water management (aquifer salinization) and infrastructure (flooding) in coastal areas, which could be costly to mitigate even when they are not catastrophic7. Thus, groundwater inundation requires a more complex assessment of adaptation tools and strategies than marine inundation alone. This study focuses on southern Oahu, Hawaii; yet the problem is applicable to most low-lying coastal lands where the water table (freshwater or otherwise) is near the surface.\\n\\nThe coastal aquifer in southern Oahu is a complex of sedimentary deposits ranging from variably porous limestone to low-permeability alluvium8 called ‘caprock’ (Fig. 1). Although the unconfined caprock aquifer is heterogeneous, it is often treated as a homogeneous unit confining the underlying basalt aquifer, which is the primary drinking-water source on the island9. In this study, we compile existing groundwater data to estimate the current water table in the southern Oahu caprock aquifer and assess how potential future SLR could affect inundation potential and timing.\\n\\nMeasured tidal efficiencies in the Honolulu and Pearl Harbor caprock aquifer (Fig. 2) show the characteristic exponential decay of amplitude with distance from the boundary (Fig. 3a). At 1 km inland, tidal amplitudes decrease to 1% of ocean amplitude. Scatter in the attenuation plot can be attributed to aquifer heterogeneity at the regional scale, plausible because of the one-dimensional simplification of the study area. The slope of the regression line fitted to observations provides an effective aquifer diffusivity of 1.3⇥105 m2 d−1 for the caprock aquifer, equation (1). Specific yield of the upper limestone unit ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 and aquifer thickness determined from well logs in southern Oahu varies between 20 m and 80 m (ref. 10), yielding hydraulic conductivity between 170 and 1,300 m d−1 (respectively; Supplementary Fig. S2a). Assuming average values of specific yield (0.15) and aquifer thickness (50 m), the unique hydraulic-conductivity estimate would be 400 m d−1. All conductivity estimates are consistent with previous estimates of the coral- and reef-limestone deposits in the upper caprock8,11.\\n\\nMeasured mean water levels are divided into wet and dry years to account for annual variations (Fig. 3b). The calculated groundwater table, equation (2), was fitted to measured data from both wet and dry years.

To obtain an independent check on the estimated groundwater level, and assuming a recharge rate over the caprock of 2.0 m2 d−1, the leakage from the basalt to the caprock aquifer is 2.0 m2 d−1, which is consistent with previously reported values11,12. To disregard individual tidal fluctuations, the offset between mean higher high water (MHHW) and current mean sea level is multiplied by the tidal efficiency with distance from the boundary and added to the mean water table to yield an estimated steady-state groundwater table at MHHW (Fig. 3b).\\n\\nThe estimated water table at MHHW is projected throughout the Honolulu and east Pearl Harbor caprock aquifer as a function of distance from the shoreline (Supplementary Fig. S1), which is the best regional estimate in the absence of further observations. Model uncertainty and sensitivity are addressed in the Supplementary Information. Flooding mostly occurs within a 1-km wide coastal zone along the shoreline, and a SLR of 0.33 m has little effect on inundation, but a 0.66 m SLR, and a more pronounced 1.0 m SLR, reveals widespread groundwater inundation of the land surface (Fig. 4b) that is much greater than marine inundation (Fig. 4a). The flooded area including groundwater inundation is twice the area of marine inundation alone for the 0.33-m SLR scenario (Table 1). For a 0.66 m SLR, the portion of groundwater inundation to total flooded area increases to 69%, and it is 58% for a 1 m SLR.\\n\\nAt first, groundwater inundation will occur infrequently, usually when high tide is coinciding with heavy rainfall. In the chronology implied by semi-empirical models13, areas lying within 0.33 m of modern MHHW are especially vulnerable to the impacts of SLR by mid-century, whereas those lying between 0.66 and 1 m are vulnerable in the latter half of the century. Throughout the study area, flooded regions occupy 0.5% within the heavily urbanized 1-km buffer for the 0.33-m SLR scenario (Table 1). Under 0.66-m SLR, inundated areas increase to 2.5% of the total area, and for 1-m SLR 5.8 km2 or 10% is flooded. The ratio of inundated areas to total area in individual aquifer systems is similar to the total numbers. However, it is noteworthy that the inundation in Waikiki (Palolo aquifer) and Ala Moana (Nuuanu aquifer) is higher with 13.5 and 19% of the area within the 1-km buffer under a 1-m SLR (respectively). This is consequential for businesses and tourism, and also for residents inland of Waikiki.\\n\\nThe vertical uncertainty for the estimated flooded areas is ±0.35 m (Supplementary Information), indicating that areas\\n\\nNATURE CLIMATE CHANGE | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | www.nature.com/natureclimatechange\\n\\n© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Furthermore, increased soil saturation may lead to a series of geotechnical and slope-stability issues. For example, rising aquifer salinity leads to corrosion of subsurface structures, including water and sewer pipes6. A higher water table may also cause increased evaporation and groundwater discharge.\\n\\nGroundwater withdrawals from wells in the study area are used for irrigation of landscaping and golf courses, small-scale agriculture, and water for cooling purposes. Although a rising sea level, seawater intrusion, and higher concentrations of brackish water in the coastal aquifer imply a degradation of water quality in places that use fresh groundwater for drinking-water purposes, the effects of SLR on caprock water resources on Oahu are minimal because potable water is not withdrawn from the caprock aquifer. Developed coastal aquifers are generally more vulnerable to groundwater extraction than to SLR (ref. 14), and because withdrawals lower water tables, it reduces the likelihood for them to rise and cause flooding. Thus, groundwater withdrawals can be used to mitigate the effects of a rising water table, even if it means pumping brackish water to avoid inundation. As groundwater inundation is largely unrecognized but potentially relevant, we recommend rigorous planning in affected areas. It is important to have a detailed understanding of the spatial distribution of the coastal groundwater level and temporal resolution of the processes that control changes in water-table height, and it is therefore essential to monitor groundwater levels continuously throughout the coastal zone.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nGroundwater levels in the coastal zone oscillate with the ocean surface; thus, mean water levels of continuous measurements provide more meaningful data than discrete measurements. Measured mean water levels in the Honolulu and Pearl Harbor caprock aquifer include observations in the Moanalua aquifer near Hickam Airforce Base in 2005 (refs 15,16), at the Greyline Terminal near the Honolulu International Airport in 2002 (El-Kadi, unpublished), and one discrete measurement at the Beretania pumping station in 2011 by the Honolulu Board of Water Supply (HBWS, unpublished), where tidal influence is negligible (Fig. 2). Water levels measured in 2005 correspond to a relatively wet year, and those measured in 2002 and 2011 correspond to relatively dry years9.\\n\\nTidal efficiency is the ratio of amplitude variation in a well compared to ocean-tide amplitude. It is conveniently used to estimate hydraulic properties, such as hydraulic conductivity and storage parameters of coastal aquifers, and is applicable to unconfined aquifers when tidal amplitudes are small in relation to aquifer thickness17,18. The relation of amplitude attenuation with distance from the boundary provides a regional aquifer-diffusivity estimate, D (m2 d−1), which yields a hydraulic-conductivity estimate, K (m d−1), assuming plausible values for aquifer thickness, b (m), and specific yield, Sy (dimensionless)19:\\n\\n|D = Kb|= x2⇡|\\n|---|---|\\n|Sy|(ln A)2⌧|\\n\\nwhere x is distance to the coastal boundary (m), A is tidal efficiency (dimensionless), and ⌧ is the period of the oscillation (d). Owing to higher correlation and thus higher confidence in the tidal efficiency, time lags are not considered in the analysis. The increase in aquifer thickness due to a sloping water table is small compared with the total aquifer thickness and effects are neglected. Tidal efficiencies were measured in the Moanalua aquifer near Hickam Airforce Base15,16, at the Greyline Terminal (El-Kadi, unpublished), in the Kalihi aquifer20, and in the Willows Pools (Palmer, unpublished; Fig. 2).\\n\\nSimplifying the observations to one dimension by assuming homogeneity of caprock-aquifer properties throughout the Honolulu and Pearl Harbor area allow estimates of a generalized water table at steady-state conditions, h (m relative to mean sea level), using the equation of Glover4:\\n\\ns 2(⇢s −⇢f)qx\\nh = ⇢ sK\\n\\nwhere ⇢s is the saltwater density (kg m−3), ⇢f is the freshwater density (kg m−3), and q is the freshwater flow per unit length of shoreline (m2 d−1). Density of salt- and freshwater is assumed 1,025 and 1,000 kg m−3 (respectively). Flow through the caprock aquifer includes surficial recharge and leakage from the basalt to the caprock aquifer. Recharge over the east Pearl Harbor caprock is\\n\\nNATURE CLIMATE CHANGE | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | www.nature.com/natureclimatechange\\n\\n© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

BILL NO.\\n\\nA BILL FOR AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 8, ARTICLE 12 KAUA‘I COUNTY CODE 1987, AS AMENDED, RELATING TO CONSTRAINT DISTRICT(S).\\n\\n### SECTION 1. Finding and Purpose.\\n\\nThe Council finds that rapid warming of the atmosphere and oceans is increasing sea level rise that threatens our natural and built environments.\\n\\nThe Council also finds that the State of Hawaii Climate Change and Mitigation and Adaptation Commission adopted a Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report. The Report with its corresponding Hawaii Sea Level Rise Viewer provide hazard and vulnerability data and maps that can be used for land management decisions.\\n\\nThe Council also finds that the Hawaii Sea Level Rise Viewer models three specific sea level rise hazards associated to increase within this century: chronic coastal erosion, annual high wave run up, and passive flooding.\\n\\nThe Council also finds that the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance has two relatively outdated and redundant Constraint Districts, the Constraint Shoreline District (S-SH) and Flood District (S-FL). Both of these Constraint Districts are now covered by much more comprehensive rules and regulations with the Special Management Area Rules and Regulations and the Floodplain Management Ordinance, respectively.\\n\\nThe Council also finds that Article 27 of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance establishes specific shoreline setback requirements to address chronic coastal erosion as well as the added impact of sea level rise on shoreline erosion. Any additional regulations concerning sea level rise impacts on coastal erosion should be done so within Article 27 of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance.\\n\\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to amend the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance’s Constraint Shoreline District (S-SH) and Flood District (S-FL) to become the Constraint Sea Level Rise District to address sea level rise impacts on annual high wave run up and passive flooding projected to occur within this century by the State of Hawaii Sea Level Rise Viewer.\\n\\n### SECTION 2.

Not surprisingly, the majority of studies on Pleistocene reefs have focused on emergent deposits elevated above present sea level as a result of either higher sea levels in the past (e.g., the last interglacial period) or local tectonic or isostatic uplift. There has been comparatively much less research on the submerged Pleistocene reef record found on insular and continental shelves. Examining the submerged record is important as it can fill key gaps in the full record resulting in a more complete understanding of late Quaternary reef accretion and sea-level change. In the Hawaiian Islands, detailed studies of submerged Pleistocene reef formations have focused primarily on deep terraces ranging from depths of ~150 to 1200 m around the Big Island of Hawaii and along the flanks of the Maui–Nui Complex, which forms the islands of Molokai, Lanai, Maui and Kahoolawe. These submerged reef systems evolved along subsiding margins, with subsidence caused by lithospheric loading associated with continued volcanism over the Hawaiian hot spot. While submerged reefs around the island of Oahu formed over the last 500 ka, reefs of the Maui–Nui Complex at similar depths are considerably older and range in age from ~0.5 to 1.2 Ma.\\n\\nThe island of Oahu has been an important locale in Quaternary reef and sea-level studies. There are two well-documented emergent Pleistocene reefal units on Oahu, the Kaena Formation and the Waimanalo Formation. Both of these units are found island-wide and include an in situ reef framework. The age of the Waimanalo Formation is well constrained and it is correlated to MIS 5e, the last interglacial period. No emergent marine units have been correlated to the intervening period between deposition of the Waimanalo Formation and Holocene reefs.\\n---\\n## Author's personal copy\\n\\nC.E. Sherman et al. / Quaternary Research 81 (2014) 138–150 139\\n\\nSherman et al. (1999) proposed that a nearshore submarine terrace scheme as modified by Embry and Klovan (1971). The cores were sampled for radiometric and petrographic analyses, taking care that each facies within a core was sampled. The ‘absolute’ ages of fossil corals were determined using the 230Th–234U–238U technique at the University of Hawaii SOEST Isotope Lab and at the U.S. Geological Survey, Denver, Colorado. Sample chips were ultrasonically cleaned in ultra-pure reagents and powdered. Mineralogy of coral samples was determined with a Scintag Pad V powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with a solid state Ge detector using Cu Kα radiation. Only those samples with b3% calcite were dissolved for Th and U isotopic analyses and spiked with 229Th and 233U. Techniques for Th and U isotopic analyses of corals in the SOEST Isotope Lab are described in Rubin et al. (2000). Total procedural blanks for this chemistry were 1–5 pg U and 5–10 pg Th. Techniques for Th and U isotopic analyses of corals at the U.S. Geological Survey laboratory are described in Ludwig et al. (1992).\\n\\nFollowing earlier workers (e.g., Muhs et al., 2002, 2012; Stirling et al., 1998), we use the following criteria to assess the reliability of Th–U ages of Pleistocene corals: (1) little or no evidence of recrystallization of coral skeletal aragonite to calcite as determined by XRD and petrography, (2) U concentrations similar to those in modern corals (~3 ppm (3000 ng/g), cf. Stirling et al., 1998), (3) low concentrations of Th (232Th b1 ppb (1000 pg/g), cf. Stirling et al., 1998) indicating the presence of little or no inherited 230Th, and (4) 230Th-age-corrected 234U/238U (i.e., initial 234U/238U or δ234U i) values similar to those of modern seawater (δ234U of ~140–155‰; cf. Delanghe et al., 2002; Muhs et al., 2012). Th–U ages of samples that meet these conditions are considered reliable to a first order (shown in bold type in Table 1).\\n\\nOpen-system processes can produce notable shifts in sample ages due to recoil redistribution of radionuclides and surface adsorption/desorption effects (Thompson et al., 2003; Villemant and Feuillet, 2003). The potential effects of such processes are discussed below.\\n\\n## Study area\\n\\nOahu (21°27′ N, 158° W) is a high volcanic island within the ~6000-km-long Hawaii–Emperor island-seamount chain that spans over 30° of latitude across the Central and North Pacific Ocean (Clague and Dalrymple, 1987). The island is composed mainly of the remnants of two great shield volcanoes, the Koolau Range (~2.6 Ma) and the Waianae Range (~3.7 Ma) (Clague and Dalrymple, 1987). Although dominated by Tertiary volcanics, Quaternary shallow-marine and eolian carbonates also constitute an important aspect of Oahu's geology occurring as a thick cap along the flanks of the extinct volcanoes. Geophysical investigations (Watts and ten Brink, 1989) and analyses of emergent Pleistocene limestones (Grigg and Jones, 1997; Hearty et al., 2000, 2007; McMurtry et al., 2010; Muhs and Szabo, 1994; Szabo et al., 1994) suggest that the island has been undergoing gradual uplift during the late Quaternary. This uplift is attributed to lithospheric flexure associated with volcanic loading and subsidence at the still volcanically active Big Island of Hawaii. Elevations and radiometric ages of emergent reefal limestones indicate that Oahu has experienced nearly 30 m of uplift since ~500 ka at an average rate of 0.02 to 0.06 m per 1000 yr (Grigg and Jones, 1997; Hearty et al., 2000, 2007; McMurtry et al., 2010; Muhs and Szabo, 1994; Szabo et al., 1994).\\n\\nThe shallow bathymetry of Oahu is characterized by a stepped topography consisting of broad shelves separated by steep eroded scarps that bear intertidal notches and other erosional features typically associated with former shorelines (Coulbourn et al., 1974; Fletcher and Sherman, 1995; Stearns, 1974). The present research has focused on the shallowest of these terraces that dips gently seaward from the shoreline out to the ~−20 m contour, where there is a sharp break in slope down to ~−30 m, at the depth of a deeper terrace. The study areas lie on the leeward (western) side of Oahu between Maili and Kepuhi Points and on the windward (eastern) side outside of Kaneohe Bay. The nearshore terrace is particularly well defined in these areas. The seafloor at these sites consists of well-lithified limestone with a thin veneer of loose carbonate sand and a sparse, patchy distribution of coral and coralline algal growth. This study focuses on cores recovered from the seaward margin of the terrace in these two areas.\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\nCores were collected via a diver-operated Tech 2000 submersible, hydraulic, rotary, coring drill with a 7.6 cm diameter diamond studded bit. Recovered limestones were classified according to Dunham's (1962) scheme as modified by Embry and Klovan (1971). The cores were sampled for radiometric and petrographic analyses, taking care that each facies within a core was sampled. The ‘absolute’ ages of fossil corals were determined using the 230Th–234U–238U technique at the University of Hawaii SOEST Isotope Lab and at the U.S. Geological Survey, Denver, Colorado. Sample chips were ultrasonically cleaned in ultra-pure reagents and powdered.

Branching corals, e.g., Pocillopora damicornis, and coralline algae in upright growth position form the in situ baffl estones. The floatstones and wackestones consist of skeletal grains and peloids supported by a lime–mud matrix. Fragments of branching corals, corals and coralline algae are the dominant skeletal grains, but mollusk, foraminifer, and echinoderm fragments are also common. Grains account for only about 10–20% of these limestones. Lime–mud matrix accounts for the remaining portions. Boring, micritization and micrite envelopes are common. Sherman et al.

(1999) found the branching-coral facies only along the inner portions of the terrace landward of the other facies. This facies was not recovered in our new cores at the seaward margin of the terrace. This distribution is consistent with the expected zonation of lithofacies in a marginal reef complex, where bafflestones and floatstones are most common in back-reef environments (James and Bourque, 1992).\\n\\nMassive-coral facies\\n\\nThe massive-coral facies consists of in situ coral and coralline-algal framestones and bindstones with coarse skeletal grainstones and rudstones infilling framework voids. Massive colonies of the lobe coral Porites lobata form the primary framework. Encrusting corals, including Montipora sp., and coralline algae form a secondary component of the framework. Outer portions of the P. lobata colonies and intraframework cavities are usually encrusted by a combination of micritic crusts and coralline algae. Vermetid gastropods are also common. Coral colonies are moderately bored and also display irregular cm-scale (possibly solutional) vugs. Semi-friable skeletal grainstones to rudstones partially fill intraframework voids. The massive-coral facies is the most common of the facies identified and is found in both windward and leeward terrace settings. Along the seaward margin of the leeward terrace the massive-coral facies constitutes core MAI5-1, most of MAI3-1 the lower 3.5 m of core WAI10, and all of cores WAI8-3 and WAI6-1. At the seaward margin of the windward terrace, the massive-coral facies forms the upper ~1 m of the KAN1 and KAN4 cores (Fig. 3).\\n\\nP. lobata is the most widespread and common of Hawaiian corals and can occur anywhere from the intertidal zone down to depths of 40 m.\\n\\nFigure 4. Schematic representation of paleoenvironmental interpretation of Pleistocene reef facies with respect to water depth and wave energy. Interpretations are based upon the paleoecologic and sedimentologic characteristics of each facies, as well as its distribution across the terrace and relationship to adjacent facies.\\n---\\n## Author's personal copy\\n\\nC.E. Sherman et al. / Quaternary Research 81 (2014) 138–150 143\\n\\nHowever, P. lobata is most common high on wave-exposed reef slopes just below the area of highest wave action between depths of 3 and 15 m (Gulko, 1998; Maragos, 1977). Grigg (1998) showed that P. lobata is the dominant frame builder in habitats exposed to high wave energy. In southwest Molokai, Engels et al. (2004) identified P. lobata as a dominant coral type within all three depth zones studied (b5 m, 5–10 m and N10 m). Webster et al. (2009) identified a shallow coral reef facies (Facies 1) from the submerged reefs around the island of Hawaii that was characterized by massive P. lobata and branching Porites compressa. The facies was interpreted as indicative of depths b20 m and likely depths b10–15 m. The dominance of massive corals (P. lobata) along with encrusting algae indicates a shallow high-energy environment of deposition (cf. James and Bourque, 1992). The combination of a grainstone and rudstone matrix with in situ framework is also common in high-energy settings (Bosence, 1985). The massive-coral facies is found along the seaward margin of the terrace. This distribution is consistent with the expected zonation of lithofacies in a marginal reef complex, where rudstones and framestones are most common in reef flat, reef crest, and reef front environments (James and Bourque, 1992).\\n\\n### Encrusting-coral facies\\n\\nThe encrusting-coral facies consists mainly of encrusting colonies of Montipora patula and Cyphastrea ocellina. These corals are found either as in situ bindstones with a semi-friable coarse grainstone to rudstone matrix, or as unconsolidated subround to angular, oblate to bladed, pebble-size clasts. The lobe coral P. lobata and the crustose coralline algae Porolithon (Hydrolithon) onkodes are secondary framework components. Unconsolidated clasts are generally abraded and coated by some combination of encrusting coralline algae and dense micritic crusts. Intraframework voids within the bindstone sections are also generally coated by micritic crusts and partially filled by internal sediment. The encrusting-coral facies constitutes the upper 4 m of core WAI10 at the seaward margin of the leeward terrace.\\n\\nAlthough M. patula can be found from the intertidal zone down past 15 m on modern Hawaiian reefs, it is most frequently found high on the reef slope or in shallow bays with moderate wave action (Gulko, 1998). In southwest Molokai, Engels et al. (2004) identified M. patula as a dominant coral type at depths b10 m. C. ocellina is usually found nearshore in shallow water, frequently in areas that have moderate wave action. The co-occurrence of these two species and their encrusting morphologies suggests that they grew in a shallow, moderate-energy environment. A secondary framework of P. (H.) onkodes also supports a shallow moderate-energy setting (cf. Adey et al., 1982; Littler and Doty, 1975). Hagstrom (1979) interpreted a similar assemblage of corals in the emergent Waimanalo Reef as representing a high-energy reef edge environment. This facies is also similar to the coral–algal bindstone facies described by Engels et al. (2004), which was interpreted as indicative of a shallow, high-energy setting.\\n\\n### Encrusting-algae facies\\n\\nThe encrusting-algae facies consists of a dense, well-lithified bindstone, composed mostly of the encrusting crustose coralline algae P. (H.) onkodes (cf. Adey et al., 1982), along with a coarse grainstone to rudstone matrix. The crustose coralline alga Tenarea tessellatum is also common. Encrusting forms of the corals C. ocellina and P. lobata and the densely branched coralline algae Porolithon (Hydrolithon) gardineri form a secondary component of the bindstone framework. The corals and coralline algae are in growth position. They are right side up and within ~30° of vertical. Micritic crusts, both laminar and knobby, are common either as laminae within the bindstone or, more conspicuously, as dense coatings on intraframework voids (cf. Sherman et al., 1999). In some cases, large, rounded, skeletal clasts are incorporated into the bindstone framework. The grainstone to rudstone matrix is generally\\n---\\n## Author's personal copy\\n\\n|A|180|shift by 16%). Of the eight samples that meet closed-system criteria, five have open- and closed-system ages that agrees to within 1% and the remaining three agree to within 3%, lending further support to the reliability of these ages. Aside from the two highly compromised corals, the open-system age shifts do not change Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage assignments and thus our interpretations of the ages. However, the implications of open-system model results for substage assignments are discussed further below. Notably, the two highly compromised, very altered samples have similar and extremely elevated 234U/238U that imply a 234U–238U age of just 30 ka, while closed-system 230Th–238U ages are 160 ka. Application of the Thompson et al. model returns MIS 5e open-system ages of these two samples, although the extreme nature of the alteration makes this result suspect, so we do not draw conclusions based on these ages in this paper.|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |160|175|75 ka|altered|\\n|δ234 U meas(‰)| |150 ka|\\n| |140|155|100 ka|\\n| |120|140|200 ka|\\n| |100| |\\n| |80|250 ka|\\n| |60| |\\n| |40| |\\n| | |20|\\n| | |0|\\n| |0.40|0.60|0.80|1.00|\\n\\n|B|120|MIS 7|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |110|175|200 ka|\\n|δ234 U meas(‰)|250 ka| |\\n| |90|155|250 ka|\\n| |80|140|\\n| |70| |\\n| |60| |\\n| | |50|\\n| |0.90|0.92|0.94|0.96|0.98|1.00|\\n\\n|C|140|75 ka|175|MIS 5|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |130| | | |\\n|δ234 U meas(‰)| | | | |\\n| |120|155| | |\\n| |110|140| | |\\n| | | |100| |\\n| |0.55|0.60|0.65|0.70|0.75|0.80|\\n|[230Th/238 U]| | | | |\\n\\nFigure 5.

On the leeward side of Oahu, there is a general trend of decreasing Th–U age of fossil corals moving seaward across the terrace. The shoreward portion of the terrace is composed of reefal material that accreted during MIS 7. Later vertical and lateral accretion occurred along the seaward portions of the terrace during the latter part of MIS 5, substages 5a to 5d. Importantly, reefal units dating to these time periods are not well documented in the emergent Pleistocene record of Oahu. Thus, examination of the accretion history of the nearshore terrace helps to fill these important gaps in the Pleistocene carbonate record of Oahu.\\n\\nTiming of MIS 7 reef accretion\\n\\nSherman et al. (1999) concluded that most of the nearshore terrace was formed by reef accretion during MIS 7. The new TIMS Th–U age data reported here and recalculation of data previously reported in Sherman et al. (1999) supports that conclusion. From the combined data set of Sherman et al. (1999) and this study, four corals of MIS 7 age meet all criteria for closed-system histories and have ages of 204.0 ± 3.5 (MIS 7b), 209.1 ± 3.6 (MIS 7c), 223.7 ± 4.3 (MIS 7d) and 249.4 ± 4.8 ka (MIS 7e). While other corals dated from the same and adjacent cores have elevated δ234Ui values and, thus, probable bias to older ages, their age range of ~210 to 248 ka still supports an MIS 7 correlation. Additionally, the new data show that the MIS 7 reef is found on both windward and leeward sides of Oahu and extends out and down to the ~−20 m contour on the windward side. In summary, coring on both windward and leeward sides of Oahu has shown that the nearshore terrace consists of in situ reef limestones. Most of these limestones and, therefore, most of the terrace are correlated to MIS 7. It is this in situ MIS 7 reef complex that has been referred to as the Waianae Reef after the locality where it was first examined (Fletcher et al., 2008; Sherman, 2000). Unfortunately, the broad range in Th–U ages of corals from the Waianae Reef makes assigning this unit as a whole to a substage of MIS 7 problematic and, rather, may indicate that it is a complex formed over multiple episodes during MIS 7.\\n\\nAges of the MIS 7 Waianae Reef are similar to those determined for MIS 7 reefs at other locales. On Barbados, up to three separate uplifted reef terraces are correlated to MIS 7 (Bender et al., 1979; Schellmann and Radtke, 2004). Based on ESR ages, Schellmann and Radtke (2004) assign these terraces ages of ~222–224 ka. Th–U ages of MIS 7 corals on Barbados determined by Gallup et al. (1994) range from ~193 to 280 ka. However, the majority of these have elevated δ234Ui values. From this data set, three corals meet closed-system criteria and have ages that range from ~193 to 201 ka, correlating to MIS 7a. On Bermuda, two coral samples from the MIS 7 Belmont Formation have reliable closed-system Th–U ages of ~199 and 201 ka, MIS 7a (Muhs et al., 2002). However, on the basis of field observations and aminostratigraphy, Hearty (2002b) correlates the Belmont Formation\\n---\\n## Author's personal copy\\n\\n146 C.E. Sherman et al. / Quaternary Research 81 (2014) 138–150 to the last interglacial period, MIS 5e. He concludes that the MIS-7 Th–U Rohling et al., 2009, 2010). Thus, the nearshore terrace contains an im- ages reported for the Belmont Formation represent the age of older reworked cobbles incorporated into the MIS-5e deposits. Corals from the MIS 7 Cortalein unit on Curaçao have ESR ages that range from ~189–226 ka (Schellmann et al., 2004b) and Th–U ages that range from ~190 to 320 ka (Muhs et al., 2012). Th–U ages of older (MIS 7) corals from the Key Largo Limestone in Florida range from ~218 to 262 (Muhs et al., 2011). Unfortunately, in both of these latter cases all samples have elevated δ234U i values indicating bias toward older ages. Following the nomenclature of Stearns (1974) this late MIS 5 reef unit has been referred to as the Leahi Reef (Fletcher et al., 2008).\\n\\nLate Pleistocene sea levels on Oahu\\n\\n### MIS 7 sea levels\\n\\nPrevious workers have concluded that over the last 500 ka Oahu has been gradually uplifting at a rate of ~0.02 to 0.06 m/ka (Grigg and Jones, 1997; McMurtry et al., 2010; Muhs and Szabo, 1994; Szabo et al., 1994). This conclusion is based on the age and elevation of emergent marine deposits on Oahu and the general progression of increasing age with elevation. Given the current models of uplift, an MIS 7 reef that formed near present sea level should be found at ~9–12 m above sea level and between the current position of the last interglacial Waimanalo Reef and the much older Kaena Reef. However, the Waianae Reef is situated some 10 to 20 m below the position of the last interglacial (MIS 5e) Waimanalo Reef.\\n\\nLimited emergent deposits at West Beach (+14 m) and Kahe Point (+15 m) may correlate to MIS 7. However, radiometric and paleoenvironmental data from these deposits are problematic. The deposit at West Beach is described as containing in situ corals by Jones (1993) and as a beach deposit by Grigg and Jones (1997). It is correlated to MIS 7 based on one electron spin resonance (ESR) age of a fossil coral of 196 ± 29 ka. Unfortunately, this locale has been destroyed due to construction of a hotel and no additional descriptions or dating of this deposit exist. The +15 m deposit at Kahe Point is also described as a beach deposit. On the basis of 6 ESR ages and 3 alpha spectrometry 230Th/234 U ages of fossil corals, Brückner and Radtke (1989) conclude that the Kahe Point unit was deposited in the Upper Middle Pleistocene (ca. 250 ka). The ESR ages range from 215 to 300 ka. 230Th/234U ages of three of these samples range from 210 to N243 ka. A fossil coral from bioclastic sand and conglomerate between 9.8 and 11.6 m at Kahe Point was 230Th–234U dated at 142 ± 12 ka by Easton and Ku (1981) using alpha spectrometry. Muhs and Szabo (1994) report two alpha spectrometry U-series dates of 120 ± 3 and 134 ± 4 ka for these deposits. Easton and Ku (1981) also reference a personal communication with Ku, who dated a coral taken from a nearby beach conglomerate exposed from 15.8 to 18.9 m above sea level at N350 ka. Szabo et al. (1994) report high-precision TIMS 230Th-ages of five corals from lithified conglomerate at Kahe Point. All have last interglacial ages. Muhs et al. (2002) reanalyzed a Porites sample from the collection of Muhs and Szabo (1994) and report an age of ~119 ka. Hearty et al. (2007) determined an MC-ICPMS-U/Th age of ~119 ka for an in situ coral from the Kahe Point deposit at +9 to +10 m, though deemed unreliable due to an elevated δ234Ui value. A growth position coral from a nearby deposit exposed at +9 to +11 m yielded a reliable MC-ICPMS-U/Th age of ~123 ka (Hearty et al., 2007). Together these data support a last interglacial age for the deposits. Thus, correlation of the West Beach or Kahe Point deposits to MIS 7 is equivocal at best, especially given that all high-precision ages of Kahe Point samples are last interglacial (MIS 5e) age. In addition, none of the 35 fossil corals from Oahu collected between 1 and 24 m above sea level analyzed by Szabo et al. (1994) have ages corresponding to MIS 7.\\n\\nThe Waianae Reef, which constitutes most of Oahu's nearshore terrace, provides a record of reef accretion and, indirectly, local paleosea level during MIS 7. Its current position suggests that it formed during a period when local sea level was below present. Within the Waianae Reef, the position of the in situ coralline algal framework (encrusting-algae facies) in the KAN1 core at the windward margin of the terrace serves as the most reliable indicator of paleosea level. The ecological specifi city of coralline alga makes them excellent paleoecologic indicators for the Quaternary (Adey, 1986). Although there is a gap in core recovery between the two facies, the Th–U ages of the KAN/windward corals provide a best estimate for the age of the underlying algal\\n\\n### Timing MIS 5 reef accretion\\n\\nTIMS Th–U ages of fossil corals reported here and in Sherman et al. (1999) are the first corals on Oahu correlated to late MIS 5 (i.e., post MIS 5e). These corals were collected along the seaward margin of the nearshore terrace on the leeward side of Oahu. The ages range from 110.3 ± 1.1 to 83.0 ± 0.7 ka, corresponding to the timing of MIS 5d to 5a (Fig. 6; cf. Rohling et al., 2009, 2010). All of these samples meet all criteria for closed-system histories. For the most part, these ages do not overlap with any reported ages for emergent reefal deposits on Oahu. A growth position coral from 1 to 3 m above sea level at Kaena Point that yielded an age of 110.5 ka is the youngest sample within the large Szabo et al. (1994) data set. This age is nearly identical to our sample WAI10-S3 collected at ~−26 m (110.3 ± 1.1 ka) and may indicate that some portion of the massive-coral facies at the base of core WAI10 accreted in an offshore environment contemporaneously with deposition of the now emergent MIS 5e Waimanalo reef. However, Szabo et al. (1994) treat this sample as an outlier and restrict the timing of the last interglacial highstand (MIS 5e) to ~131–114 ka. More recently, Muhs et al. (2002) determined new, higher-precision ages of different coral samples from the same Szabo et al. (1994) Oahu localities. These data show a somewhat more restricted range of ages for the Waimanalo Formation, with a youngest age of ~113 ka and most ages between ~125 and ~115 ka. TIMS Th–U ages of fossil corals from the tectonically stable, far-field site of Western Australia indicate that the last interglacial highstand lasted from 128 to 116 ka (Stirling et al., 1998), which corresponds closely to the estimated timing and duration of the highstand based on Oahu data (Muhs, 2002; Muhs et al., 2002; Szabo et al., 1994). Ages of emergent MIS 5e reefs on Curaçao (Muhs et al., 2012) and in south Florida (Muhs et al., 2011) indicate that the last interglacial highstand ended by ~118 ka and 114 ka, respectively. An age of ~110 ka corresponds most closely to the timing of the MIS 5d stadial lowstand (cf. Cutler et al., 2003; Rohling et al., 2009, 2010). Thus, the young (~110 ka) ages reported for the emergent Waimanalo Reef are problematic and the age of our sample reasonable in the context of falling sea level from MIS 5e to 5d.\\n\\nAll of the other Th–U ages of corals from the leeward margin reported here are b110 ka and do not overlap with any reported ages of emergent deposits on Oahu. These corals have ages of 104.6 ± 1.1 ka and 97.0 ± 1.2 ka, which bracket the timing of MIS 5c, and 83.0 ± 0.7 ka, which correlates to MIS 5a (Dorale et al., 2010; Potter et al., 2004; Ages of emergent MIS 5e reefs on Curaçao (Muhs et al., 2012) and in south Florida (Muhs et al., 2011) indicate that the last interglacial highstand ended by ~118 ka and 114 ka, respectively. An age of ~110 ka corresponds most closely to the timing of the MIS 5d stadial lowstand (cf. Cutler et al., 2003; Rohling et al., 2009, 2010). Thus, the young (~110 ka) ages reported for the emergent Waimanalo Reef are problematic and the age of our sample reasonable in the context of falling sea level from MIS 5e to 5d.\\n---\\nC.E. Sherman et al. / Quaternary Research 81 (2014) 138–150\\n\\nAuthor's personal copy\\n\\nThe broad range in Th–U ages of the overlying corals precludes correlation of the algal framework to a specific substage within MIS 7. The algal framework is found from ~−25 to −19 m tracking the position, within ~1 to 2 m, of slowly rising sea level over an ~2000 to 3000 yr span within MIS 7. This framework may have been uplifted by ~4 to 5 m, using a lower uplift rate of 0.02 m/ka, or by as much as 11 to 14 m, using an uplift rate of 0.06 m/ka. The upward change in facies from encrusting algae to massive corals in the KAN1 core may represent a relative increase in the rate of sea-level rise. The position of the algal framework in core KAN1 may indicate the position of sea level during a stadial within MIS 7.\\n\\nThe shallowest dated coral from the Waianae reef is from ~−10 m (Sherman et al., 1999). Corrected for uplift, this coral framework likely formed from ~14 to 24 m below the present datum. Correlative back-reef limestones extend up to ~−6 m (Sherman et al., 1999) suggesting that sea level on Oahu during MIS 7 could have reached ~−5 m (not corrected for uplift). When corrected for uplift, the position of the Waianae Reef suggests that it formed when local sea level was ~9 to 20 m below present. Because of the considerable depth range of extant examples of the corals recovered in cores, all paleosea level estimates presented here should be regarded as minima.\\n\\nSea-level estimates for MIS 7 based on shallow-marine carbonate records at other locales vary from approximately −20 m to +9 m relative to modern sea level. Records indicating MIS 7 sea levels well below present include cores from Mururoa Atoll (French Polynesia) where MIS 7 sea levels are estimated to have been ~10 to 20 m below present. Correlation between the uplifted reef terrace record of the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea and the marine oxygen isotope record suggests MIS 7 sea levels of ~−20 m to near the present level. Similarly, the raised terraces of Barbados suggest MIS 7 sea levels of ~−20 m to +9 m. On Curaçao, an island with estimated late Quaternary uplift rates similar to those of Oahu, MIS 7 sea levels are estimated to have been from approximately −3 to +2 m.\\n\\nThe position of the Waianae Reef on Oahu supports lower than present central North Pacific sea levels during much of MIS 7 though does not preclude higher MIS 7 sea levels. However, the paucity of emergent MIS 7 deposits and apparent lack of an emergent in situ MIS 7 reef framework versus the extensiveness and geomorphic prominence of the submerged Waianae Reef make it clear that the principal locus of reef accretion on Oahu during MIS 7 was some 10 to 20+ m below present sea level.\\n\\nDetailed investigations of MIS 5 show increasing evidence that this period was more complex than originally thought with rapid, suborbital-period sea-level changes occurring within isotopic substages. MIS 7 could have been equally complex. Submerged speleothem records from the Mediterranean indicate that MIS 7 consisted of three high sea-level stands at ~249 to 231 ka (MIS 7e), 217 to 206 ka (MIS 7c), and 202 to 190 ka (MIS 7a), each of these rising to above −18 m. These records also indicate that sea level remained below −18 m from 231 ka to 202 ka (MIS 7d through 7b) and further constrain that sea level remained between −21 and −18 m from 217 to 202 ka, or throughout MIS 7c and 7b.\\n\\nMost records of MIS 7 sea levels close to present sea level converge on an age of ~200 ka or MIS 7a. The Oahu record suggests that such an excursion to sea levels near present during MIS 7a, if it occurred, was either short lived or otherwise not conducive for reef growth. If an MIS 7a highstand near present was of sufficient duration, perhaps there was not adequate accommodation space for reefs to grow as has been the case for Holocene reefs around Oahu.\\n\\nDifferences in MIS 7 sea-level estimates based on reef records from different locales can be due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) effects. Spatial variability in past interglacial sea level positions of over 10 m can be expected and depend on factors such as proximity of a site to ice margins, loading and unloading history of ice sheets, duration of the interglacial and Earth's rheological response. Oahu is considered a far-field location with respect to GIA effects. Accordingly, the local sea-level record should exhibit less GIA-induced deviation from the eustatic signal than more near-field sites such as Florida, the Bahamas and Bermuda. However, in addition to GIA processes, vertical movements associated with volcanic loading at the Big Island of Hawaii must be accounted for when interpreting the Oahu record.\\n\\nMIS 5 sea levels\\n\\nCorals dating to late MIS 5 (post-MIS 5e) were recovered from the seaward margin of the terrace on the leeward side of Oahu (cores WAI10, WAI8-3, and WAI6-1). At the close of the MIS 5e highstand at ~113–115 ka, sea level dropped below present and the Waimanalo reef was abandoned, as indicated by the lack of Waimanalo coral ages less than ~113 ka. Accretion continued offshore at the seaward margin of the terrace between ~−20 and −30 m (~−24 and −34 m corrected for uplift), as indicated by the ages of samples WAI10-S2, WAI10-S3, WAI8-3S1A, and WAI6-1S1 (~110–83 ka). The antecedent topography of the MIS 7 Waianae Reef provided a suitable substrate for continued reef accretion. There is no evidence of subaerial exposure between samples WAI10-S3 and WAI10-S2, which suggests that sea level stayed above −25 m (~−30 m corrected for uplift) between ~110 and 104 ka (i.e., MIS 5d). This is supported by TIMS Th–U ages of corals from submerged fossil reef tracts in the Florida Keys. At higher stratigraphic levels in the WAI10 core there is a facies change from massive coral to encrusting corals that suggests sea level continued to fall. The encrusting-coral facies is indicative of a relatively shallow, moderate to high-energy environment. Sample WAI10-S2 has an age of ~105 ka.\\n---\\nAuthor's personal copy\\n\\nC.E. Sherman et al. / Quaternary Research 81 (2014) 138–150\\n\\nWAI8-3S1A has an age of ~97 ka. Together they bracket the age of the depth (Grigg and Epp, 1989). The upper limit is controlled by wave highstand associated with MIS 5c (Potter et al., 2004). Continuing seaward, sample WAI6-1S1 has an age of ~83 ka, correlating to MIS 5a (Dorale et al., 2010; Potter et al., 2004). The position of the late MIS 5 corals on Oahu (i.e., the Leahi Reef) and the lack of emergent MIS 5a–5c corals are consistent with local sea levels being below present during this interval. The general trend of decreasing age with distance offshore may suggest that accretion was occurring over a period of general sea-level fall during the latter part of MIS 5.\\n\\nSea levels lower than present during MIS 5a and 5c are supported by sea-level estimates based on the deep-sea oxygen isotope record (e.g., Rohling et al., 2009, 2010). Similarly, numerous reef records indicate sea levels of ~10 to 20 m below present for both MIS 5a and 5c. These include uplifted reef terraces of Barbados and New Guinea (Bard et al., 1990; Chappell and Shackleton, 1986; Cutler et al., 2003; Gallup et al., 1994; Potter et al., 2004; Schellmann and Radtke, 2004; Schellmann et al., 2004a) and submerged relict reefs on the more tectonically stable southeast Florida shelf (Toscano and Lundberg, 1999). While there is some evidence for higher sea levels during MIS 5c (e.g., Coyne et al., 2007), most records indicate sea levels well below present. In contrast, MIS 5a sea level positions are much more debated. Although the records cited above indicate MIS 5a sea levels below present, there are numerous sedimentary records from locales including Bermuda, the Bahamas, the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain and Grand Cayman that indicate 5a sea levels close to or slightly above the present level (Coyne et al., 2007; Ludwig et al., 1996; Muhs et al., 2002; Vacher and Hearty, 1989; Wehmiller et al., 2004). Additionally, a speleothem record from the western Mediterranean indicates that MIS 5a sea level was ~1 m above modern sea level (Dorale et al., 2010). As with the MIS 7 Waianae Reef, the position of the late MIS 5 Leahi Reef on Oahu does not preclude higher sea levels at this time, but does indicate that, if higher sea levels occurred, conditions were not suitable for extensive reef accretion at this time. Additionally, GIA effects can account for at least some of the spatial variability in late MIS 5 sea-level records.\\n\\nHolocene versus Pleistocene reef accretion\\n\\nAn interesting outcome of this research lies in what was not found. In 30 separate cores from both windward and leeward settings and ranging between water depths of ~5.5 and 35 m, no evidence of Holocene reef accretion was found. Rather, the seafloor is undergoing extensive biological and physical erosion (cf. Grossman et al., 2006). Signatures of subaerial exposure and meteoric diagenesis are recognized in the upper several centimeters of all cores (cf. Sherman et al., 1999). Holocene accretion is limited to sparse patches of coral and coralline algae. This paucity of Holocene reef accretion over a Pleistocene foundation is similar in some respects to the submerged Pleistocene outlier reefs along the south Florida bank margin (Lidz et al., 1991). Holocene accretion in Hawaii appears to be largely limited by wave forces (Dollar, 1982; Dollar and Tribble, 1993; Fletcher et al., 2008; Grigg, 1983; Grigg, 1998; Grossman and Fletcher, 2004; Grossman et al., 2006; Rooney et al., 2004). Episodic destruction of coral communities by storms and open-ocean swell and the removal of carbonate material from nearshore reef zones prevent cementation, lithification, and reef accretion (Dollar and Tribble, 1993). Why extensive and thick reef sequences were able to develop during the Pleistocene but not during the Holocene at these sites remains an important question.\\n\\nThick Pleistocene reefs of Oahu owe their existence to having had more time and more accommodation space than Holocene reefs. The broad range of ages for both Waianae and Leahi Reefs indicates that these are complexes built over long-periods of time (20–40 ka), though perhaps not continuously, and over successive substages within an interglacial. In contrast, Holocene accretion has occurred within the last ~8 ka as sea level rose and flooded the nearshore terrace (Fletcher et al., 2008). Reef accretion in Hawaii occurs within a narrow growth window. The lower limit of positive net accretion is ~−30 m, critical for reef accretion (Dollar and Tribble, 1993).\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThis research was supported by National Science Foundation (EAR-9710005), US Geological Survey and National Geographic Society.

In order to adapt, planners and the public seek estimates of shoreline change with high confidence and accuracy. The complexity of shorelines produces considerable uncertainty in the timing, location and magnitude of change. We present and discuss a probabilistic shoreline model for SLR planning.

We discuss the advantages of a probability-based model for SLR adaptation, including for prioritizing actions, phasing, visualizing risk and uncertainty, and improving adaptive management.\\n\\nKeywords\\n\\nclimate change adaptation, sea-level rise, probability models, shoreline change\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nSea-level rise (SLR) presents significant risks to coastal settlements, infrastructure, cultural resources, and sensitive species habitats. Increasingly, planners, resource managers, and policy-makers must identify how, where, and when to adapt to changes resulting from SLR, while minimizing the impact to human populations, natural systems, or both. Incorporating future hazards associated with SLR, such as coastal erosion and beach loss, into land use planning is vital to land use policy. This article presents a probabilistic model of coastal hazards associated with SLR that makes explicit scientific uncertainty and discusses its application to land use planning for the next 50–100 years, using the example of a Hawai`i coastal community.\\n\\nCoastal managers, planners, and engaged communities in adaptation planning seek projections of SLR impacts and want to examine what specifically is at risk, what the magnitude of the impact might be, and how long they have to prepare. Historical data or geometric models are commonly used to forecast hazards. Yet, the dynamic nature of open coast environments is difficult to model accurately for every specific place. Consequentially, there have been recent calls for the use of probabilistic forecasts of future shoreline change and associated hazards as a basis for coastal adaptation with the explicit incorporation of uncertainty.\\n\\nCorresponding Author: Daniele Spirandelli, University of Hawai`i-Manoa, Saunders Hall 107, 2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA.

However, the dynamics of a used to plan for SLR adaptation. The second part uses the coastline make it difficult to predict future SLR-induced erosion with a high degree of confidence and place-based accuracy. SLR, in particular, presents several challenges for land use planning and coastal management. SLR is a long-term problem that is mostly “invisible” from daily problems because it progresses relatively slowly (Moser 2005). Thus, it may not be obvious that there is a direct causal link between the slow, creeping process of SLR and the acute impacts of storms, flooding, and erosion, which, in turn, makes it difficult to isolate SLR from other coastal processes. Another challenge is the considerable uncertainty in understanding the geographic patterns, timing, and magnitude of future impacts of SLR, especially (1) uncertainties associated with future global emissions scenarios that affect the future rate of SLR, and (2) uncertainties associated with the relationship between SLR and shoreline change. This article is primarily concerned with the latter as it influences local efforts to plan and adapt to a shifting coastline.\\n\\n## The Need to Plan for and Adapt to Sea-Level Rise\\n\\nOne of the anticipated impacts of climate change is SLR threatening low-lying areas around the globe (IPCC 2014). The implications to coastal systems are significant, including the physical impacts from submergence, flood damage, saltwater intrusion, rising water tables, wetland loss, and accelerated coastal erosion (Nicholls and Cazenave 2010). Future accelerated SLR is particularly worrisome for many of the world’s sandy beaches that already experience chronic erosion and are expected to experience more land loss. A recent study estimates 6,000 to 17,000 km2 of coastal lands will be lost globally during the twenty-first century due to SLR-induced erosion and between 1.6 and 5.3 million people may be forced to migrate (Hinkel et al. 2013). As most of the world’s population lives within 60 km of the coastline, community infrastructure and support services are also at risk. Critical habitat for many sensitive species in the shoreline are currently under threat because of degradation and loss of coastal lands; additional loss of marshes, dunes, and beaches due to the “coastal squeeze” could spell disaster for many of the world’s shorebirds, sea turtles, and seals (Defeo et al. 2009; Pontee 2013). For example, sea level rise might further reduce shoreline habitat for Hawaiian monk seals to rest, pup, nurse, and mate (National Marine Fisheries Service 2016).\\n\\nBeach loss due to SLR is the consequence of more than just the inundation of coastal lands. As sea levels rise, beaches and dunes transform as a consequence of climate-induced oceanographic processes (e.g., storms, waves, and currents), sediment supply and transport dynamics, and human activities that alter sediment movement (Nicholls 2010; Williams 2013).\\n\\nCoastal managers and planners look for credible scientific information to facilitate coastal adaptation, the management of resources, and the implementation of strategies over time\\n---\\nSpirandelli et al.\\n\\nIntegrating hazards into land use planning involves technical analysis of shoreline change. Yet, this is problematic because extrapolation does not account for future SLR and, oftentimes, past records to determine rates are incomplete. An alternative approach commonly used is the “Bruun Rule,” a simple mathematical model that relates SLR to shoreline retreat based on the conservation of beach volume. Using two variables, SLR and beach slope, the model essentially predicts that, as sea-level rises, sediment erodes from the upper part of the beach and is deposited on the nearshore bottom while maintaining the original slope of the beach (see model details in Appendix A).\\n\\nThe Bruun rule has been criticized for its limiting assumptions of the physical setting. For example, it assumes no sediment sources or sinks and ignores the effects of surrounding geology, man-made constraints, and sediment availability. It also runs the risk of being applied incorrectly as a “one model fits all,” with SLR as the only important factor always causing shoreline retreat. There are variations of the Bruun Rule, such as the R-DA method, which alter the underlying assumptions of the model and incorporate more accurate sediment transport processes. Yet, because these models are derived from the Bruun Rule, they suffer from similar inaccuracies.\\n\\nThe risk characterization process for hazards is more than a scientific effort or summarizing activity, it is decision-driven from the outset, recognizes all significant concerns, reflects both analysis and deliberation, and is designed to be appropriate to the decision. Thus, there is growing acceptance that adaptation efforts should take place at the community level, with an assessment process closely involving local stakeholders. Characterizing the risks requires information and data on the local impacts of SLR on shorelines with sufficient detail to quantify the risks associated with future SLR. Risk is defined as the product of the probability or likelihood of an event and its consequence. The consequence (or set of consequences) is associated with the exposure to future hazard(s). Uncertainty is inherently a part of identifying risks as uncertainty can affect the probability and consequences of risk. Taken together, a risk-based approach to coastal adaptation implies the use of a place-based model that can approximate the impacts of SLR and its uncertainties over the next fifty to hundred years.\\n\\nModels can estimate the impacts and risks of SLR both quantitatively and qualitatively. Simple quantitative approaches include the “bathtub” model, where, under a given SLR scenario, land lower than a particular sea level is presumed inundated. The bathtub approach has been used widely for modeling impacts, particularly with the advent of high-resolution digital elevation data. However, this assumes static SLR and ignores the dynamics of the coastal environment and geomorphic feedbacks, in particular the physical reorganization of sediment material leading to shoreline migration. Another quantitative approach is to extrapolate trends of historical shorelines to project future shoreline change.\\n\\nCommunity engagement is essential to ensure citizen interest in natural hazards and to obtain broad support for the implementation of plans and policies. Recommendations for climate change adaptation agree that risk-based management approaches are more effective. Better decisions can be made if they are place-based and contain a sequential adaptive management approach. Moser, Williams, and Boesch assert that this proactive approach involves six components: (1) careful risk identification; (2) vulnerability assessment and evaluation; (3) systematic development and assessment of adaptation strategies; (4) iterative decision making combined with deliberate learning; (5) decisions with long time horizons that maximize flexibility, enhance robustness, and ensure durability; and (6) a portfolio of approaches rather than single technological fixes or market mechanisms.\\n\\nBy comparison, probabilistic forecasts can provide a more transparent basis than deterministic predictions for management decisions by communicating the inherent uncertainty in future coastal hazards. For this reason, there have been calls for the incorporation of probabilistic methods to account for both uncertainty in model outputs and the complexity in coastal change. Probabilistic approaches to inform SLR impacts have been developed in several planning domains, most commonly in order to assess the probability of coastal flooding.\\n\\nModels Predicting Coastal Impacts of SLR\\n---\\n## Journal of Planning Education and Research\\n\\nTo examine change in exposure across the Southeast Australian coast. Recently, probabilistic methods have gained momentum in the beach management sphere to incorporate the temporal-spatial variability of shoreline change (Callaghan, Roshanka, and Andrew 2009; Ranasinghe, Callaghan, and Stive 2011). Baron et al. (2014) incorporates the uncertainty associated with both SLR and changing beach dynamics using a probabilistic approach to map shoreline change hazards with varying confidence levels. Lentz et al. (2015) used a Bayesian network to assign probabilities to sea-level rise, elevation, and land cover that take into account a static response (inundation) and a dynamic response to SLR (e.g., sediment transport dynamics and ecosystem migration). To our knowledge, probabilistic approaches have not been adopted and applied in a community land-use decision-making context for adaptation planning.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\nProbability-Based Model of Shoreline Change in Hawai`i\\n\\nWe use a hybrid geometric-historical model to estimate shoreline change under SLR in Hawai`i. This model is similar to the Bruun rule in its beach response to SLR; however, it adjusts the morphology of the beach with data on changes in the local sediment budget. This model was constructed to take advantage of a probabilistic approach to define bounds of uncertainty and represent future shoreline with likelihood estimates. It is intended to provide an assessment of erosion exposure over a large coastal area while taking into account SLR and local long-term sediment behavior. The details of this model are explained elsewhere (Anderson et al. 2015). For the purposes of this article, we present a brief overview of the model variables and how they estimate present and future rates of shoreline change.\\n\\nIn this model, the rate of change in shoreline position is approximated using three critical variables: future SLR, a coastal beach profile, and historical shoreline positions. Figure 1 graphically depicts the model with arrows to show the relationship between model variables. \"Future SLR in excess of historical SLR\" is estimated based on the IPCC AR5 high-end \"business as usual\" climate scenario (RCP 8.5) for SLR. This scenario was selected based on State planning agency preference for the most cautious predictions of SLR for long-range planning purposes. Future SLR is calculated by subtracting local absolute SLR (from Honolulu tide gauge data) from the IPCC AR5 global mean sea-level estimate. \"Coastal beach profile\" is constructed from beach survey transects of cross-shore elevations—previously conducted for years 1994–1999 on the islands of O`ahu and Maui, and 2006–2008 for shorelines on O`ahu and Kaua`i (Fletcher et al. 2012). Each beach profile is geomorphically adjusted for future SLR. Shoreline change is approximated using historical shoreline position data from high-resolution aerial photographs and NOAA Topographic charts as part of the USGS National Assessment of Shoreline Change (Fletcher et al. 2012). Using a model of a coast with a fringing reef that responds to future SLR, shoreline change rate is predicted combining historical shoreline position data with coastal beach profiles that are adjusted for projected SLR (Anderson et al. 2015). We provide the model equation and methodological details in Appendix A.\\n\\nBy 2100, Hawai`i shorelines are forecasted to retreat 2.5 times farther inland than historical shoreline trends (Anderson et al. 2015). On average, Hawai`i beaches are expected to retreat 11.3 meters by 2050 and 31.2 meters by 2100 (Anderson et al. 2015). However, there is considerable variability in erosion estimates both across and within coastal areas. The Ka`anapali coast of Maui (Figure 3, inset) exemplifies the variability in shoreline change and the challenges in predicting future erosion. Although shoreline retreat is expected to dominate, the area will alternate in shoreline recession and accretion. Additionally, the coastline experiences substantial seasonal fluctuations. Because of its west-facing aspect, episodic seasonal swells can have a sudden and dramatic impact on the beaches. These episodic yet significant events can get lost in the historical data and therefore are difficult to incorporate into model parameters. Additional sources of uncertainty are also generated because of errors in the construction of beach profiles and in areas with shorter time series of historical data.\\n\\nA unique feature of the model is its treatment of uncertainty. Individual probability density functions (pdf) at each beach transect are produced combining probability distributions of (1) future SLR, (2) coastal beach profile and dune data, and (3) historical shoreline change rate. A final pdf is produced to determine the mean, median, and various\\n\\nDownloaded from jpe.sagepub.com at University of Hawaii at Manoa Library on July 21, 2016\\n---\\nSpirandelli et al.\\n\\npercentiles using the cumulative distribution function of the pdf for the projected shoreline (Figure A1 in Appendix A.). Using these pdfs, we define a series of probability-based shoreline change hazard zones for planning periods of interest.\\n\\nShoreline Change Hazard Zones\\nwater beach\\nSimilar to Baron et al. (2014), we define shoreline change hazard zones by exploiting the confidence bands surrounding the future shoreline position. At periods of interest, shoreline hazard zones are defined by the probability that the shoreline will be further landward than an existing position. For example, the 20th percentile of the pdf (see Figure 2) is the location where there is a 20% probability that the shoreline will retreat, at least, to this location. Figure 2 graphically illustrates hazard zones that depict probabilities of shoreline change exceedances. These zones provide coastal planners and decision makers with the ability to select probabilities that best match the local community risk tolerance. For example, members of the Hawaiian community may have a low-risk tolerance for the loss of iwi kupuna (burials) and therefore will use the most conservative zone, 20–49 percent probability of exceedance. By contrast, planners may use a moderate zone of 80–90 percent probability because they have a higher risk tolerance for the erosion of the beach. The development of these hazard zones facilitates (1) a risk and vulnerability assessment and (2) the explicit incorporation of uncertainty into community planning and decision making for SLR adaptation.\\n\\nApplication of Model for Adaptation Planning in Ka`anapali, Maui\\n\\nMaui is a useful illustrative case to explore the application of this probability approach because the island experiences some of the highest rates of erosion among Hawai`i beaches and has an established policy framework for integrating hazards into shoreline planning. Historical data show 85 percent of Maui beaches are currently eroding and 11 percent are completely lost (Fletcher et al. 2012). As a result, Maui’s local resources, physical structures, infrastructure, and tourism developments face substantial risk and, in turn, can influence the use of protective measures such as seawalls and shoreline hardening. It is well documented that—unfortunately, and perhaps ironically—while these structures are intended to prevent erosion, they actually often have spill-over effects, intensifying beach erosion in adjacent areas by interrupting the natural flow of sand, leading to further narrowing of beaches (NRC 2007; Norcross-Nu’u et al. 2008).\\n\\nMaui integrates hazards planning into land use decisions under the regulatory authority of the Hawai`i Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program. The county is also actively engaged in adaptation efforts (Owens et al. 2012). Hawai`i established a shoreline setback policy under Chapter 205A.\\n\\nDownloaded from jpe.sagepub.com at University of Hawaii at Manoa Library on July 21, 2016\\n---\\n## Journal of Planning Education and Research\\n\\nFramework for Prioritizing Adaptation Needs\\n\\nWe develop a framework for prioritizing adaptation needs based on the risk and onset of impacts to coastal resources, structures, and infrastructure in erosion hazards zones for three time frames: 2030 (near-term), 2050 (mid-term), and 2100 (long-term). We evaluate risk based on the probability of erosion and time frames—assigning “less likely” to 20–49 percent; “more likely than not” to 50–79 percent; and “likely/very likely” to 80–100 percent—which draws on best practices for qualitatively characterizing and reporting uncertainty (CCSP 2009). We modify decision matrices, originally developed by the California Emergency Management Agency and the California Natural Resource Agency for the Cal-Adapt program (cal-adapt.org), to help local jurisdictions prioritize and identify adaptation strategies (Boswell, Greve, and Seale 2012).\\n\\n| |Less Likely (20-49%)|More Likely Than Not (50-79%)|Likely/Very Likely (80-100%)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|2030 (Near-Term)| | | |\\n|2050 (Mid-Term)| | | |\\n|2100 (Long-Term)| | | |\\n\\nResults\\n\\nThe outputs from the two models are graphically represented in Figure 3. This map depicts four probability hazard zones that qualify shoreline change from “less likely” to “most likely” for 2030, 2050, and 2100. We overlay the projected future shoreline from the Bruun Rule (dashed line). There are three zones that are noteworthy to visually compare. The first is the beach in the northern portion of the North Ka`anapali Coast, an area just south of Kekaa Point and located in front of the Sheraton Maui. This area has shown a steady trend of net accretion over the last 80 years. However, because of seasonal differences in wave exposure, the beach width varies noticeably between winter and summertime. Here, the Bruun Rule is likely to overpredict the future erosion hazard because it does not account for the steady net gain in sediment. The second noteworthy zone is the shoreline in front of the Ka`anapali Alii hotel (central portion of Figure 3). Similar to the first zone, this portion of the beach experiences large changes in sediment transport because of oscillating directions of incoming seasonal swells. For example, during the summer of 2003, an extreme erosional event from a south swell in conjunction with a high water level caused the loss of more than 200 feet of beach, as well as inland flooding, which prompted the installation of steel road plates to protect the sidewalk from eroding. As the summer swell subsided, and the winter swell season began, more than 100 feet of beach was reestablished in front of the hotel. These episodic events in both of these locations produce hazard zones marked by bands of high uncertainty (20–49 percent “less likely”) and moderate uncertainty (50–79 percent “more likely than not”). Conversely, the Bruun Rule results only indicate one predicted location (relatively near the current vegetation line).\\n\\nFuture Shoreline Hazard Zones\\n\\nWe perform an impact assessment of the Ka`anapali coastline to SLR-induced erosion, using GIS (ArcGIS version 10.2.2), within erosion hazard zones at given probabilities for near-term (2030) medium-term (2050) and long-term (2100). For comparison, we also estimate exposure to future erosion due to SLR determined by the Bruun Rule. We create hazard polygons using the most recent low water mark as the seaward boundary, whereas 90th, 80th, 50th, and 20th percentiles of the cumulative pdfs were used as the landward boundaries of each zone. We assign qualitative characterizations to their respective probability field, as discussed above. Because the percentiles of the cumulative pdf represent the given probability that the future shoreline will be landward of the particular line, the erosion zones equate the minimum amount of eroded land at a given probability. We project the probable erosion hazard zones for 2030, 2050, and 2100. We estimate structural and land use impacts by extracting data on land cover types, parcel areas, building footprints, building and land values, and SLR-induced erosion, using GIS (ArcGIS version 10.2.2), within erosion hazard zones at given probabilities for near-term (2030) medium-term (2050) and long-term (2100). For comparison, we also estimate exposure to future erosion due to SLR determined by the Bruun Rule. We create hazard polygons using the most recent low water mark as the seaward boundary, whereas 90th, 80th, 50th, and 20th percentiles of the cumulative pdfs were used as the landward boundaries of each zone. We assign qualitative characterizations to their respective probability field, as discussed above. Because the percentiles of the cumulative pdf represent the given probability that the future shoreline will be landward of the particular line, the erosion zones equate the minimum amount of eroded land at a given probability.\\n---\\n## Spirandelli et al.\\n\\nFigure 3.

The third noteworthy area is in front of the Marriott and Hyatt Regency properties (Figure 3). This area is less dynamic than the first two. It experiences less gross sediment transport, yet suffers from both episodic erosion and long-term chronic erosion (Fletcher et al. 2012). As a result, the Bruun Rule likely underpredicts future shoreline change because it does not account for the chronic loss of sediment.\\n\\nWe calculate the total predicted land area exposed to future erosion using the Bruun Rule and the probability model for 2030, 2050, and 2100 (Table 2). The Bruun Rule estimates 18.4, 19.6, and 24.5 acres at risk for the three time periods, respectively. By comparison, the probability model generates the ranges: 10.8–26.8 (2030), 12.5–30.8 (2050), and 19.2–45.8 (2100) acres. Overall, the output from the Bruun Rule has a smaller footprint (in total land area) than all probability model zones combined, but according to independent studies and as illustrated here, the Bruun Rule likely overpredicts in some areas and underpredicts in other areas.\\n\\nDownloaded from jpe.sagepub.com at University of Hawaii at Manoa Library on July 21, 2016\\n---\\n## Journal of Planning Education and Research\\n\\n| |Bruun Rule|Very Likely (≥90%)|Likely+ (≥80%)|More Likely Than Not + (≥50%)|Less Likely+ (≥20%)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Near-term (2030)|18.4|10.8|14.1|20.5|26.8|\\n|Midterm (2050)|19.6|12.5|16.4|23.6|30.8|\\n|Long-term (2100)|24.5|19.2|24.8|35.2|45.8|\\n\\nNote: The superscript plus sign indicates cumulative probability zones (e.g., “Likely+” = “Very likely” + “Likely”).\\n\\nTable 3 reports total private property acreage, length of zones, number of structures, and property values within each probability erosion zone for 2030, 2050, and 2100. In the near term, 4.1 acres of coastal land are likely or very likely to be affected by erosion, which represents $7.3 million in property value. By comparison, in the near term, more than double that amount of land (8.8 acres) is more likely than not eroding, signaling a potential loss of nearly $19 million. Although there is less likelihood, an additional 6 acres of coastal land are at risk of exposure in the near term, which is valued at approximately $16 million. Projecting into the future, we estimate that nearly 7 acres (almost double the 2030 acreage) are likely to be affected by 2050, and more than twice that amount (over 15 acres) by 2100.\\n\\nBuilding structures do not appear urgently at risk in the near-term, yet between two and four buildings might be at risk. Given that these buildings represent upward of $1 billion in investment, further assessment and evaluation is warranted. By 2100, it is likely that three buildings will be affected by erosion, and there is a chance that somewhere between five and fifteen buildings could also be at risk, with values potentially running as high as $1.4 billion.\\n\\nIn the near-term, roads do not appear directly at risk. Although less certain, portions of an arterial road and a major highway may be at risk (between 322 and 615 feet). Projecting further into the future, the likelihood of road exposure increases. By 2050, 368 feet of road will likely be at risk and by 2100, more than 1,000 feet of road will likely be at risk.\\n\\n### Discussion\\n\\nWe estimate exposure and map risks for the Ka`anapali coast of Maui, a shoreline with tremendous value to the local culture, population, and tourism industry. It is also a location that will likely experience accelerated rates of erosion due to SLR, threatening the future of the beach. Further, the development pattern of the coastline, which is primarily composed of static resort amenities, buildings, and infrastructures, prevents shoreline migration, producing the proverbial “coastal squeeze.” We compared the outcomes of two models that estimate future erosion hazards zones, one that adopts the Bruun Rule, a widely used deterministic approach to predict future erosion, and another that is a hybrid model that takes advantage of likelihood estimates to produce probable hazards zones. We discuss the four principal benefits of a probability-based model for adaptive coastal risk management: (1) as a tool for prioritizing adaptation actions, (2) the phasing of adaptation strategies and investments with long lead times, (3) to visualize risk and associated uncertainty, and (4) for adaptive management.\\n\\n#### Prioritizing Adaptation Actions\\n\\nOutputs from probability-based models are useful for prioritizing climate adaptation efforts. In our illustration, areas that fall within the 50–80 percent probability hazards zones are at risk in the next fifteen to thirty-five years and require immediate attention by the local planning agency and community. Local efforts may want to engage stakeholders in identifying sensitive social, ecological, and cultural systems that are vulnerable to near-term erosion, as well as appraising adaptation strategies. Care must be taken not to interpret these risks as short-term. The erosional pattern may be part of a long-term trend, which, if viewed through too narrow a lens, can influence shortsighted measures that prove maladaptive or detrimental. For instance, protective responses such as shoreline hardening, which has already made its imprint on more than 70 percent of Maui’s shoreline (Norcross-Nu’u et al. 2008), aimed at reducing acute losses and thus increasing land or resource value, may eventually fail because of the long-term trend of SLR. Moreover, such strategies may produce negative externalities and spatial spillover effects by increasing the local rate of erosion downshore (Fletcher et al. 2012). There is general agreement that when current climate risks are large, such as chronic and accelerated rates of erosion under SLR, addressing these risks in combination with more distant risks may be the most effective and efficient adaptation strategy, leading to desirable outcomes, as discussed below (Füssel 2007).\\n---\\n|Figure 4.

What seems critical is how the science and information is produced and presented. Tribbia and Moser (2008) found that California coastal managers sought uncertainty ranges around climate change impact projections, well-founded distinctions between more and less likely impacts, a better scientific basis for uncertainty buffers, and a basic understanding of the reasons for the uncertainty. These and other authors suggest explicitly incorporating uncertainty into the framing of risk and the risk scoping process can facilitate better land use decisions at the local level (Mills et al. 2015). Third, the ability to visualize risks, even though their reliability may be questioned, enables decision makers to analyze and discuss acceptable exposure and calculate the risk of doing nothing. If potential exposure is deemed serious—and this raises sociopolitical considerations as to individual judgments—then a more comprehensive probabilistic assessment may be justified, providing an opportunity for disparate groups to contribute their expertise on areas and features of importance. This is critical in Hawai`i because future shoreline erosion could threaten cultural artifacts and other features along the coast that will require unique adaptation strategies because they are nonrenewable (Kane et al. 2012). Community involvement in risk assessments not only engages communities, it also establishes normative goals and fosters trust among parties, essential ingredients in “wicked” post-normal situations characterized by long time horizons, uncertainty over outcomes.\\n\\nVisualizing Risk and Uncertainty We map levels of risk associated with erosion hazards as a form of risk communication. There are three main benefits of risk maps that explicitly incorporate uncertainty. First, because one of the central goals of risk communication is to raise awareness of risks so that individuals do not underestimate low-probability risks (CCSP 2009), the type and method of communication is important; specifically, incorporating estimates of uncertainty gives more legitimacy to the risk assessment process and the outcomes are deemed fairer (CCSP 2009; Moser, Williams, and Boesch 2012). Second, uncertainty in climate impact predictions allows coastal planners and managers to make more informed decisions (Tribbia and Moser 2008). Although\\n\\nDownloaded from jpe.sagepub.com at University of Hawaii at Manoa Library on July 21, 2016\\n---\\nSpirandelli et al.\\n\\nmultiple interests, and high stakes (Moser, Williams, and planning. We propose five recommendations for planning Boesch 2012; Preston, Yuen, and Westaway 2011; van Aalst, researchers and coastal managers working on climate adaptation for SLR in using shoreline change models for land use planning: (1) acknowledge and communicate uncertainty in existing spatial data and modeling, and, if possible, develop quantitative estimates of uncertainty, otherwise use qualitative estimates, but be explicit about how those estimates were derived; (2) use a probabilistic-based approach to map hazards zones at local scales to visualize risks and educate stakeholders; (3) identify time frames and link them to probabilistic projections for longer term planning; (4) adopt community-level risk mapping and other participatory methods to engage a wide spectrum of stakeholders in the risk assessment and risk management process; and (5) establish a robust adaptive risk management framework using a probabilistic method to monitor risks, revisit strategies, and revise goals and assessments in light of changing information.\\n\\nAdaptive Management\\n\\nAdaptive management provides a blueprint for incorporating new data and to re-assess adaptation strategies. Probability-based predictions, such as those discussed in this article, are likelihood estimates, where the outcome depends on the stakeholders; (3) identify time frames and link them to probabilistic projections for longer term planning; (4) adopt community-level risk mapping and other participatory methods to engage a wide spectrum of stakeholders in the risk assessment and risk management process; and (5) establish a robust adaptive risk management framework using a probabilistic method to monitor risks, revisit strategies, and revise goals and assessments in light of changing information.\\n\\nThis study only assessed the exposure of buildings, lands, structures, and land use using readily available county GIS data. A more thorough assessment would need to identify and assess the exposure of other assets, resources, and sensitive ecosystems. The probability model only considered one climate change scenario (RCP 8.5 Business as Usual). Depending on the planning objective, it would be instructive to develop another series of probability hazards zones based on a less conservative SLR scenario or worse-case scenario (e.g. Greenland ice caps collapse). In addition, a full vulnerability assessment would consider multiple hazards associated with SLR, such as coastal erosion with inundation or storm surge. A natural next step would be to combine these hazards zones with other assets (particularly cultural features and sensitive species habitats) that may be critical for adaptation planning.\\n\\nThe Role of Governance\\n\\nA significant obstacle to the use of the model is less about the model itself and more about governance. Prioritizing climate adaptation and placing the importance of high-quality adaptation plans on local government agendas remains a deficiency. Learning from past disasters, local governments lack motivations to prepare and implement strong hazards mitigation plans because of few external incentives and an indifferent public, a phenomenon that Raymond Burby calls the “local government paradox” (Burby 2006). This is of great concern because, as we have seen, $1.4 billion in real estate alone is at risk from future erosion in Ka`anapali, Maui. Berke and Lyles (2013) argue that there is a need for more acceptance of shared responsibility for addressing public risks. While new governance structures are no doubt necessary for truly transformative climate change adaptation (Berke and Lyles 2013; Moser, Williams, and Boesch 2012), we believe an important first step involves empowering planners and communities with a better capacity to understand and communicate public risks.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this article, we present an illustrative case using a probability-based model of shoreline change to SLR for adaptation\\n\\nDownloaded from jpe.sagepub.com at University of Hawaii at Manoa Library on July 21, 2016\\n\\nAppendix A\\n\\nBruun Rule Equation\\n\\n∆y\\n= ( Sf - S0 ) / tan β\\nwhere\\n\\nΔy is the net change (-Δy is retreat) in mean shoreline position;\\nSf - S0 is the rise in sea level between future sea level Sf and initial sea level S0;\\ntan β is the slope of the beach profile, up to the berm.\\nProbability-Based Model of Shoreline Change\\n\\n∆y\\n= r t( f - to ) - ( Sf - Shist ) / tan β\\n---\\n## Journal of Planning Education and Research\\n\\nwhere Declaration of Conflicting Interests\\n\\n- Δy is the net change (-Δy is retreat) in mean shoreline position between initial time t o and future time t f ;\\n- r is the historical shoreline change rate;\\n- ( S f - S hist ) is the difference between the IPCC projected sea level and Hawaii extrapolated sea level at time t f ; and\\n- tan β is the average slope of the submerged portion of the beach profile.\\n\\nA probability density function (pdf) is produced for ∆y, the net change in shoreline by combining pdfs of the three variables depicted in equation 2.

We urge use of these funds to protect treasured Sunset Beach. Here is our two-part proposal.\\n\\nFirst, we encourage the administration to change course from the past and crack down on expired emergency hardening permissions granted to coastal property owners. Reporting by the Star-Advertiser clearly demonstrates a strong legal justification for acting on expired permits. Beaches are a vital ecological, cultural, and public resource. The state has a fiducial obligation to enforce laws aimed at protecting these public trust lands.\\n\\nHouses falling onto the sand, debris littering nearshore waters and limitations to public access are all symptoms of our failure to uphold the public trust doctrine, and an inadequate response to the scientific reality of sea level rise. Any doubts harbored by coastal stakeholders regarding the threat posed by sea-level rise should be reconsidered in light of recent stunning findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC states with “high confidence” that: “Sea level is committed to rise for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep-ocean warming and ice-sheet melt and will remain elevated for thousands of years.”\\n\\nSecond, we encourage the Legislature to appropriate funds to purchase every property west of the bridge at Sunset Beach and makai of Kamehameha Highway. This buyout of fewer than 50 parcels should extend all the way to the undeveloped parcel at Rocky Point. Based on public property tax records, we estimate this action will cost less than $115 million, about 6% of the budget surplus. In the short term, the state could lease the majority of these properties back to their current owners, or whomever else may be interested; hardened waterfront lots should be returned to nature so that the beach, and public access, can recover.\\n\\nAlternatively, this solution could move immediately to the long-term fix and get these at-risk properties out of nature’s way in order to establish a spacious new public beach park and parking lot. Empirical models by our University of Hawaii research team show clearly that these parcels are vulnerable to growing erosion and annual wave inundation over the next 50 years.\\n\\nBenefits include:\\n\\nDon't miss out on what's happening!

Parcel owners would have a fair exit strategy from a situation that otherwise has no good ending and a lease-back program allows the state to recoup some of its investment.\\n\\n2. In the long term, the new park could be conveyed to the city or a nonprofit such as the North Shore Community Land Trust with extra funds to construct additional parking and potentially another shower facility.\\n\\n3. Extra parking will alleviate traffic and the new park will allow residents and visitors to enjoy this beautiful and iconic shoreline. Rightly so, the new administration is addressing the affordable housing crisis. Although this solution would remove a small percentage of Hawaii’s housing stock, this decision would result in an equitable outcome for local families living on or near this coastline. Why? Because the state has an obligation to protect public beaches but no obligation to provide payouts to private property owners whose risky investment in coastal real estate was taken by the rising ocean. This one-time solution for a hazardous area with high public value allows property owners to leave with fair market value instead of the degraded parcel value that sea level rise will inevitably impose in the future.\\n\\nThis action also presents an opportunity for the government to pilot another policy tool by making suitable but currently undeveloped land available for land swaps with interested local families who would like to remain close to their friends and relatives.\\n\\nThis one-time acquisition would not set any legal precedent and moving forward we are not endorsing the creation of a government policy to purchase coastal property that it will otherwise acquire for free as the unstoppable shoreline moves mauka. This move must be done in concert with increased enforcement of state and county laws intended to protect public coastal resources.\\n\\nTo any akamai buyer, the fair market value of these properties is already diminished and will continue to decline with each successive inch of sea level rise. While this action is expensive, it is affordable in light of the current budget surplus, and the benefit to present and future generations of Hawaii is immeasurable.\\n\\nChip Fletcher, Ph.D., is interim dean of the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of Hawaii-Manoa; Colin Lee is a climate change and resiliency policy analyst, UH-Manoa Climate Resilience Collaborative.\\n\\nClick here to see our full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.

Fletcher2\\n\\nAbstract: The goal of this study was to determine the maximum annually recurring wave height approaching Hawai‘i. The motivation was scientific as well as administrative: to enhance understanding of the recurring nature of dominant swell events, as well as to inform the Hawai‘i administrative process of determining the ‘‘upper reaches of the wash of the waves’’ (Hawai‘i Revised Statutes [H.R.S.] § 205-A), which delineates the shoreline. We tested three approaches to determine the maximum annually recurring wave, including log-normal and extremal exceedance probability models and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) analysis using 25 yr of buoy data and long-term wave hindcasts. The annual recurring significant wave height was found to be 7.7 G 0.28 m (25 ft G 0.9 ft), and the top 10% and 1% wave heights during this annual swell was 9.8 G 0.35 m (32.1 ft G 1.15 ft) and 12.9 G 0.47 m (42.3 ft G 1.5 ft), respectively, for open North and Northwest Pacific swell. Directional annual wave heights were also determined by applying hindcasted swell direction to observed buoy data lacking directional information.\\n\\nThe islands of Hawai‘i lie in the midst of a large swell-generating basin, the North Pacific. Tropical storms tracking to the northwest and north of the Islands produce winter swell with breaking face heights exceeding 5 m several times each year. These swell events lead to concerns over coastal erosion, coastal flooding, and water safety for the large population of ocean communities in Hawai‘i.\\n\\nRunup generated by the largest of these waves poses a hazard to coastal development by flooding roadways, undermining structures, and causing erosion. According to Hawai‘i state law (Hawai‘i Revised Statutes [H.R.S.] § 205-A) the highest runup of these annual swells sets the legal position of the shoreline.\\n\\nIn Hawai‘i, the shoreline serves as a reference line used to delineate public beach access, construction setbacks, state conservation land, submerged lands, and the border of management jurisdiction. Several states define the shoreline differently; for example, California uses the mean high water mark and Massachusetts uses the mean low water mark based on tidal water levels (not including wave setup or runup). In 1968, the State of Hawai‘i changed the definition of the shoreline from the mean high water mark to the highest reach of the waves (Ashford v. State of Hawai‘i). The State of Hawai‘i definition of the shoreline is ‘‘the upper reaches of the wash of the waves, other than storm and seismic waves, at high tide during the season of the year in which the highest wash of the waves occurs, usually evidenced by the edge of vegetation growth, or the upper limit of debris left by the wash of the waves’’ (H.R.S. § 205-A).

October 2008\\n\\nThe State of Hawai‘i has established a coastal management system that relies on this definition of the shoreline, not only as a demarcation of public shoreline access, but also to establish a baseline for construction control and development setbacks. The discord of private landowners seeking to preserve or develop the economic value of their property and public ocean users wishing to access and preserve pristine coastal environments is responsible for continuing debate over shoreline laws. Resolving the annually recurring maximum wave height around the Islands would improve the scientific basis to understanding the shoreline definition, because this line is set by the upper limit of wave runup resulting from the largest or set of largest annually recurring waves (under optimal runup conditions). Runup is not a simple function of wave height; rather the interaction of different wave conditions and topography determine runup. However, wave height is a fundamental determinant of runup; contrary to topography, which is fixed as a data set, wave height is not. This paper provides the description of maximum annually recurring wave heights in Hawai‘i for such purpose.\\n\\nLocal consulting engineers as part of their respective design projects on the coast are required to describe the regional and local wave climate. This analysis typically consists of specifying the largest characteristic ranges and scatter tables or rose diagrams of wave height, period, and direction of the dominant swell regime for the area of interest. Such engineering reports (e.g., Noda and Associates 1991, Bodge and Sullivan 1999, Bodge 2000) do not give detailed statistical analyses of the recurring nature of swells in Hawai‘i.\\n\\nTo provide a comprehensive analysis, we wish to resolve the annually recurring maximum wave based on the best records and state-of-the-art methods. The determination of the annually recurring wave height is also the first step to ensuring a sound scientific basis for policy-based decision making involved in the determination of the shoreline as defined by H.R.S. § 205-A.\\n\\n### Previous Work\\n\\nThe seasonal wave cycle in Hawai‘i has been explored in several different publications. Moberly and Chamberlain (1964) outlined the wave cycle in terms of four swell regimes: North Pacific swell, northeast trade wind waves, Kona storm waves, and southern swell. We have added a wave rose to their original graphic depicting annual swell heights and directions (Plate 1).\\n\\nThe seasonal wave cycle in Hawai‘i is characterized by large North Pacific swell and decreased trade wind waves dominating in winter months and southern swell accompanied by increasing trade wind waves dominating in summer months. However, large-scale oceanic and atmospheric phenomena including El Nin ˜o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are thought to control the number and extent of extreme swell events (Seymour et al. 1984, Caldwell 1992, Inman and Jenkins 1997, Seymour 1998, Allan and Komar 2000, Wang and Swail 2001). Extreme wave events have been argued to control processes such as coral development (Dollar and Tribble 1993, Rooney et al. 2004) and beach morphology (Moberly and Chamberlain 1964, Ruggiero et al. 1997, Storlazzi and Griggs 2000).\\n\\nAlthough there are several factors that contribute to annual variability in maximum wave height in Hawai‘i, including the ENSO and PDO cycles, we seek to resolve the mean maximum annual signal from both highs and lows of these cycles. Ruggiero et al. (1997) evaluated extreme runup using empirical equations as a means of calculating frequency of dune impact. This empirical approach or a more robust process-based numerical modeling approach could similarly be used to evaluate the extent of extreme runup in Hawai‘i based on the annual maximum wave height. This study could provide boundary conditions for a more sophisticated wave transformation and runup model for identification of the shoreline in Hawai‘i for a particular location.\\n---\\n|FIC|SWELL|\\n|---|---|\\n|Annual2825|Significant|51001|51201|51202|045\"|\\n|Wave Height|6 m|258\"|51003|\\n| | |1| |51002|51004|\\n|WaveBuoy IDBuoy| |2105|ORM|WAVES| |1479 1470|123\"|\\n| | | |SQUTHERNSWELL| | |Mo kn|\\n\\nPlate 1.

Vitousek and Fletcher 543\\n\\nmaterials and methods\\n\\nTo determine the annually recurring maximum wave height we used the record of wave buoys from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and Wave-Watch III (WWIII) model hindcasts from the Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory’s (CHL) Wave Information Studies (WIS) program (Vicksburg, Mississippi).\\n\\nHourly reports of significant wave height (average of the largest one-third of wave heights, Hs) and other meteorological information from monitoring buoys are available from NOAA’s NDBC Web site (http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/Maps/Hawaii.shtml). Based on the observation that wave heights follow a Rayleigh distribution, we can use the significant wave height to estimate other statistics of a swell, such as the mean wave height or the top 10% wave height, based on the significant wave height. These buoys have an instrument precision of 0.2 m, which results in small errors (less than 5% for all waves above 4 m).\\n\\nOur focus concerned buoy 51001 (buoy 1), which is located 315 km northwest of the island of Kaua‘i and is moored at a depth of 3.25 km. The buoy has recorded 25 yr of wave height and period data, since 1981.\\n\\nBuoy 1 is ideally located to record North and Northwest Pacific swell without interference from neighboring islands. Only recently has buoy 1 been able to record swell direction. Thus the time series recorded in the majority of buoy 1 data and by all of the remaining buoys lack swell direction. The lack of observations of wave direction means that any analysis of open North Pacific and Northwest Pacific swell is limited to data from buoy 1 because all the remaining buoys are significantly affected by island blockage. However, hindcasts using WaveWatch III can be used to recover directional information.\\n\\nLong-term statistical analysis was applied to the simple case of the 1-yr recurring significant swell height. Statistics of extremes can usually be extrapolated to approximately three times the length of the time series. Because we were primarily interested in the annually recurring maximum wave height, our 25-yr time series was more than adequate to resolve this value. Long-term statistical models are typically applied to long-return-period events such as the 50- to 100-yr events; such methods were originally developed to define stream flood heights or return periods from discharge records (Gumbel 1941). Although typically applied to long-return periods, they can also be applied for short- and intermediate-return periods. The following procedure was used to construct our long-term statistical model:\\n\\n1. Large swell events (n per year) from the buoy record were assigned an exceedance probability (see equation).\\n2. Log-normal and extremal models used linear regressions to determine the relationship between large swell events and exceedance probability (the probability that a larger swell event will occur during the return period). To corroborate this analysis Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) probability models also determined the relationship between large swell events and exceedance probability using Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE).\\n3. Methods including removing outliers and the peak over threshold (van Vleder et al. 1993) method were evaluated to improve model performance.\\n4. These statistical models assigned probabilities to a full range of swell heights and were modified to give the relationship between swell heights and return period (particularly the 1-yr return period).\\n5. The maximum annually recurring wave height is determined from the tail of a Rayleigh distribution.\\n\\nThe log-normal statistical model was constructed on the assumption that maximum swell events will plot as a linear function on a horizontal logarithmic scale of exceedance probability. Exceedance probability (Q = 1 - p) was given by the probability that the next swell will be greater than the sorted\\n---\\n## PACIFIC SCIENCE . October 2008\\n\\nFigure 1.

The largest wave heights recorded by buoy 1 are plotted versus the negative log of exceedance probability in (A) and plotted versus the return period in (B). In these models the largest event (a 12.3 m significant wave height) outlier has been removed and the peak over threshold method is used with a threshold of 5 m.\\n\\nwave events on record as if drawing from a hat containing all the maximum swell heights and the next swell event.\\n\\nWave Height Q = Exceedance probability = (1 - p)N\\n\\n|Wave Height|Q = Exceedance probability = (1 - p)N|\\n|---|---|\\n|Hs1|N + 1 High probability the next swell will be larger.|\\n|Hs2|N + 1|\\n|Hs3|N + 2|\\n|...|...|\\n|HsN|N + 1 Low probability the next swell will be larger.|\\n\\nIn this procedure, Hs1 is the smallest significant wave height, HsN is the largest significant wave height, and N is the total number of waves in the analysis. Selecting different numbers of events (n) per year, such as the single maximum significant wave height each year or the top 25 significant wave heights, can yield different results as discussed later.\\n\\nOur long-term statistical analyses were performed using the significant wave height. To determine the maximum wave height that occurs with a given significant wave height requires further statistical analysis on a probability distribution of random waves.\\n\\nOur results fell into two categories: results using the log-normal and extremal exceedance probability models and results using the GEV models.\\n\\n### Log-Normal and Extremal Models\\n\\nThe log-normal model of exceedance probability versus wave height, as seen in Figure 1, is quite linear on a log (x-axis)-linear (y-axis) scale.\\n\\nFigure 1A shows a log-normal model of the data, with the following equation:\\n\\nHs = A[log Q] + B\\n\\nwhere A and B are regression coefficients.\\n\\nAn extremal model of the same data is shown in Figure 1A and uses the following equation, which differs from the log-normal model by the 1/k exponent term (below),\\n\\nwhich serves to limit the occurrence of ex-\\n---\\nMaximum Annually Recurring Wave Heights in Hawai‘i .

This allows determination of the annually recurring significant wave height. The relationship between the exceedance probability (Q) and the return period (TR) is\\n\\nTR = r:i: Q\\n\\nwhere r:i: is the recurrence interval.\\n\\nThe return period is simply the recurrence interval, r:i: (1/70 yr because we used the top 70 events each year) divided by the exceedance probability (Q). In this case 70 events was the smallest number of recorded wave heights in a year of buoy data, because the buoy was not operating for the majority of 1983 due to maintenance issues.\\n\\nThe 1-yr return period is given in Figure 1B as 7.67 ± 0.014 m. The confidence levels, CI, shown in Figure 1A and B are given by the typical confidence interval equations for a linear regression:\\n\\nCI\\ntN 2; 1 a/2(SE) N + (x P(x m) m) 2\\nwhere t is given by the student-t statistic, a is the significance level, m is the mean, and SE is the standard error given by the equation\\n\\nSE = (1/N) Σ(y ^y) 2\\n\\nThis 1-yr return swell event has an annual return probability percentage based on the recurrence interval of the time series given by the equation:\\n\\nE = 1 1 r:i: TR\\n\\nwhere E is the probability that we will encounter the event (64% for the following conditions), r:i: is the recurrence interval (1/70 yr), TR is the return period (1 yr), and L is the life span (1 yr). According to the buoy 1 time series, significant wave heights exceeding 7.7 m have occurred in 16 of the\\n---\\n## Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) Model\\n\\n1 p = ILTR = 1-0.333/1=0.666 Year return wave height = 7.7 [m]\\n\\n1 ri. = 3 largest events per year Significant Wave Height [m]\\n\\nFigure 2.

The GEV statistical model returns results very similar to those of the log-normal and extremal models, which focus on our estimates of the annually recurring significant wave height.\\n\\n### Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) Model\\n\\nThe GEV distribution is applied to determine relationships between wave height and return period with particular focus on the annually recurring wave height. Introduced by Jenkinson (1955), the GEV distribution uses Gumbel (type I), Frechet (type II), and Weibull (type III) distributions for different values of the shape parameter, k = 0, k < 0, k > 0, respectively. Iterative maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) fit the observed data to find the best estimates of the shape, scale, and location parameters of the GEV cumulative distribution function, F(x), given by:\\n\\nF(x)\\nexp(1 + k(x - m))\\nfor k ≠ 0\\nexp(exp((x - m)))\\nfor k = 0\\n\\nBased on given probability distributions and the return period probability equation pTR = 1 - r:i:, wave height for an arbitrary TR return period is found. The GEV model is more robust than the previous approach because it combines the Gumbel, Frechet, and Weibull extreme value distributions, although it yields very similar results to our log-normal and extremal analysis (Figure 2). The GEV analysis, being a more robust model, remains largely unaffected by the presence of the 12.3 m event.\\n---\\nMaximum Annually Recurring Wave Heights in Hawai‘i .

Observed directional annually recurring maximum significant wave heights ðHsÞ given from ðAÞ extremal and ðBÞ GEV models. Recovering Swell Directionality from Model Hindcasts Thus far the annually recurring wave height analysis is applicable to open North and Northwest Pacific swells because no information of wave direction has been considered. By using WaveWatch III (WWIII) model hindcasts concurrent with buoy data to recover the directionality of wave heights, we can determine the annually recurring maximum wave heights for a particular direction window. WWIII is an ocean-scale spectral wave model on a 0.5-degree grid that computes open swell generation and propagation based on spatial wind fields. WWIII has been well validated using buoy and altimetry data (Tolman 2002, Baird and Associates 2005, Tracy et al. 2006). Figure 3 and Table 1 show the annually recurring maximum significant wave heights according to buoy data for extremal and GEV models for swell direction windows of 30 degrees. Applying modeled direction to the actual buoy data may seem problematic, but it is the best option to ensure preference toward observed over-modeled wave height. As can be seen from\\n\\nFigure 3, observed directional annually recurring maximum significant wave heights produced by both models are similar as are results from the observed versus modeled wave heights shown in Table 1. The north to northwest windowed annual significant wave heights found in Table 1 are smaller than the previously determined value of 7.7 m because the largest events used in the analysis do not fall into the same 30-degree windows. This limiting effect is caused by the directional variability of north swells, which typically range clockwise from 270 to 90 degrees (W–E). Analysis of all northern-facing swell directions (270 to 90 degrees) recovered this 7.7 m annual wave height. Southern swell occurs in much more narrow-banded directions, typically ranging clockwise from 150 to 210 degrees (SSE–SSW ) and therefore should be much less affected by the limiting effect of the directional variability. Significant Wave Height versus Maximum Probable Wave Height It is important to keep in mind that 7.7 m is the annually recurring significant wave height\\n---\\n## TABLE 1\\n\\n|Window|Lower|Upper|Source|Observed Annual Hs (m): Extremal Model|Modeled Annual Hs (m): Extremal Model|Observed Annual Hs (m): GEV Model|Modeled Annual Hs (m): GEV Model|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |0|30|Buoy1|5.75|6.1|5.85|6.15|\\n| |30|60|Buoy1|6|6.5|6|6.45|\\n| |60|90|Buoy4|5|5.25|5.1|5.37|\\n| |90|120|Buoy4|4.1|4.2|4.3|4.32|\\n| |120|150|Buoy4|3.1|3.1|2.75|2.65|\\n| |150|180|Buoy2|2.5|2.4|3|2.95|\\n| |180|210|Buoy2|2|2.1|2.35|2.35|\\n| |210|240|Buoy1|1.5|1.5|1.6|1.65|\\n| |240|270|Buoy1|2.1|2.2|1.5|1.6|\\n| |270|300|Buoy1|4|4.5|3.7|3.9|\\n| |300|330|Buoy1|6.2|6.7|5.9|6.4|\\n| |330|360|Buoy1|6|6.5|5.8|6.2|\\n\\nNote: Wave hindcasts of buoy 3 did not return more than one swell event per year in the southerly and westerly directional windows; hence buoy 1 was used instead.\\n\\nFor the average of the highest one-third of the wave heights. Each wave height data point from the buoy record used in the analysis was part of a swell train that certainly contained larger waves. The significant wave height represents the typical observational state of the ocean, not the very largest waves that occur during a swell event. To determine the largest 10% and 1% of wave heights, we assumed that the probability distribution of the waves followed a Rayleigh distribution, which has the following probability distribution function (pdf):\\n\\np(H) = 2H / Hrms * exp(-H^2 / Hrms^2)\\n\\nwhere p(H) is the probability of encountering a wave of a given height, H, and Hrms is the root mean square wave height, which is equal to Hs / sqrt(2). The average of the 10% largest waves is given by the following equation:\\n\\nAvg: of H10% = ∫ y H10% p(H) dH\\n\\nor more generally; ∫ y Hpct% p(H) dH\\n\\nwhere H10% or (Hpct%) is given by the equation: Hs / sqrt(2 ln pct), where pct is the percentage.\\n\\nThe assumption that random waves follow a Rayleigh distribution has been shown to be quite good for deep-water waves with a narrow-banded wave spectrum (Longuet-Higgins 1952) (i.e., waves created by a single swell event rather than two converging swell events). With a given pdf, one can determine several parameters of interest, such as the\\n---\\n## Maximum Annually Recurring Wave Heights in Hawai‘i - Vitousek and Fletcher\\n\\nAvg Tcp % = 1.67Hs\\n\\n| |Avg: of Top 10%|1.3|1|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|3526|30%|25.6|20.6|15.0|10%|5.6|\\n\\nFigure 4.

Hmax = 1.86Hs = 14.3 m This analysis, for Hmax, is based on 1,000 waves and represents wave conditions that would occur for a peak swell duration of around 4.44 hr assuming the typical wave period is 16 sec.

This motivates a sensitivity test to determine the optimal number of events to use. Notably, as more events are selected per year the annual recurring wave\\n---\\n## Sensitivity of Statistical Model\\n\\nFigure 5. Sensitivity of models to number of largest events selected per year.\\n\\nHeight is higher for the log-normal and extremal models and lower for the GEV model after a peak at about 10 events per year. However when large numbers of events are selected (N &gt; 10) the return wave height prediction for the log-normal and extremal models begins to stabilize (Figure 5).\\n\\nThis increasing annual recurring wave height result for the log-normal and extremal models is due to the trend that as more events are selected per year, the data become saturated with lower swell events, which tend to dominate the behavior of the regression. Because a majority of data points behave with a return period of less than 1 yr, the log-normal model predominantly captures the behavior of the frequency of short-return-period events at the expense of long-period data. This can be seen in Figure 6: the log-normal fit is quite good for short-return-period data and problematic for long-return-period data.\\n\\nIn dealing with estimates of the annually recurring significant wave height, it is somewhat unrealistic to give a confidence level on the order of centimeters when dealing with waves exceeding 7 m, although by this analysis it may be statistically acceptable to do so. Rather, we make a recommendation that accounts for the variability by using different numbers of events selected each year that typically range &gt; 0.2 m and the instrument precision, which is also &gt; 0.2 m. Summing the error in quadrature gives a confidence level of 0.28 m and still represents a very\\n---\\nMaximum Annually Recurring Wave Heights in Hawai‘i .

When a large number of events are used in analysis, the log-normal model is strongly fit to the high-frequency events (which represent the bulk of the data) at the expense of the extreme events. The fit of the wave heights versus the negative log of exceedance probability is shown in ðAÞ, and the fit of wave heights versus the return period is shown in ðBÞ.\\n\\nnarrow band of about 3.5% of the wave height.\\n\\nThus our recommendation for the annually recurring significant wave height in Ha-wai‘i is 7.7 G 0.28 m (25 ft G 0.9 ft), and the top 10% and 1% wave heights during this annual swell are 9.8 G 0.35 m (32.1 ft G 1.15 ft) and 12.9 G 0.47 m (42.3 ft G 1.5 ft), respectively. For good measure we also multiply the confidence level by the coefficient given on the y-axis of Figure 4, so that the confidence levels represent the same percentage of the final value. The difference between selecting the annually recurring significant wave height as 7.5 or 7.7 or somewhere in between is fairly trivial, especially for engineering calculations, because the difference between selecting one or the other results in a maximum difference of only 3.5%.\\n\\nIt is important to note that this analysis considers only deep-water wave heights, which are not the same as wave heights near the shoreline. There are several physical processes that can cause deep-water wave heights to increase or decrease when propagating into shallower water, such as shoaling, refraction, diffraction, and nonlinear interactions. There are a number of theories and methods that are used to model the transformation from deep-water wave heights to nearshore wave heights, including linear wave theory, spectral and phase-resolving wave models, and empirical equations. Caldwell (2005) applied this approach for predicting the observed breaking wave height at Waimea Bay, Hawai‘i, from the deep-water wave height recorded by buoy 1.\\n\\nIt is also important to keep in mind that Hmax represents the single largest wave that would occur during a swell event, and perhaps the 10% or 1% highest wave conditions (depending on the acceptable risk tolerance) would be more representative of all of the largest waves in a swell event. Another benefit of using the top 10% or 1% of wave heights is that information about the number of waves in a particular swell is not required.

The concept is presented for windward Oahu, Hawai‘i. Statistical models of extreme wave height and recently developed empirical runup equations (Stockdon et al. 2006) provide extreme runup levels, which overlay geo-referenced aerial photos and high-resolution LIDAR elevation models. The alongshore wave height variability that contributes to alongshore runup variability is accounted for by the SWAN spectral wave model. Sea level is found to play a significant role in future inundation levels.\\n\\n## INTRODUCTION\\n\\nSea-level rise of 0.5-1.4 m (Rahmstorf 2007) is expected by the end of the 21st century. Previous work on the long-term impacts of sea-level rise has focused on flooding of low-lying coasts. Raising the static water level on a digital elevation model (i.e., passive flooding) displays the dramatic long-term effects of sea-level rise. The short-term effects of sea-level rise include increased frequency and severity of wave overtopping and wave attack, resulting in coastal inundation, erosion and morphological changes. The nature of these short-term impacts on coastal communities is still undetermined and may pose significant risk.\\n\\nManaging the risk of coastal flooding is a balancing act between the base elevations of nearshore infrastructure and base flood elevations. Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are created to manage development siting.\\n\\nTo evaluate the risk of coastal flooding to nearshore communities, we use a practical approach to map extreme wave inundation and the influence of sea-level rise.\\n---\\n## Location Map:Waimanalo, Oahu, Hawai'i\\n\\nFigure 1 - Location Map of case study: Waimanalo, Oahu, Hawai'i\\n\\n## METHODS\\n\\n|1)|The 1st (standard) approach:|\\n|---|---|\\n| |a) Determine recurring wave height statistics.|\\n| |b) Translate the wave height to wave runup using empirical equations.|\\n| |c) Map the runup elevation spatially on a digital elevation model.|\\n| |d) Apply sea-level rise to assess risk.|\\n|2)|The 2nd approach (includes historical erosion analysis):|\\n| |a) Determine recurring wave height statistics.|\\n| |b) Translate the wave height to wave runup using empirical equations.|\\n| |c) Map the runup elevation spatially on a digital elevation model.|\\n| |d) Apply sea-level rise and an erosion rate to assess risk.|\\n|3)|The 3rd approach (includes nearshore wave transformation):|\\n| |a) Determine recurring wave height statistics.|\\n| |b) Model the nearshore wave transformation using the SWAN model.|\\n| |c) Translate the wave height to wave runup using empirical equations.|\\n| |d) Map the runup elevation spatially on a digital elevation model.|\\n| |e) Apply sea-level rise to assess risk.|\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, managing the risk of coastal flooding is a balancing act between infrastructure elevations and total runup elevations. The key to evaluating the potential risk is estimating both of these elevations as accurately as possible.\\n\\nTo determine infrastructure and ground elevations, we use high-resolution aerial LIDAR surveys conducted by the NOAA Coastal Services Center Coastal Remote Sensing.\\n---\\nProgram in winter 2005, with 95% of the data having less than 31.8 cm horizontal error (Circular Error Envelope – CE95) and a vertical accuracy of 1 cm.\\n\\nThe evaluation of runup elevations requires a statistical approach. Our approach follows Ruggiero et. al. (2001) who estimated extreme water levels (sum of extreme runup and extreme tides) to determine the frequency of dune impact and resulting morphology of the Oregon coast.\\n\\nIn this study, NOAA’s wave-monitoring buoy (NDBC buoy 51001) provides data for statistical analyses of maximum return wave heights for Waimanalo. The Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution gives the relationship between wave height and return period. The maximum return runup elevations are then derived from empirical relationships to the maximum return wave heights. In this approach, we apply the maximum return runup elevations at the Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) mark. Consideration of the joint probability of high waves and high tides may improve the total water level prediction; however, it is left to future work.\\n\\nOur approach to determining the total runup juncture on a beach profile is analogous to FEMA’s approach to determining FIRMs using their computer code RUNUP 2.0. Several shore-normal transects in the form of rectangular grid lines (5 m resolution) are cast on the shoreline of interest, and the analysis is performed on an individual transect basis. Beach profiles at each shore-normal grid line are extracted from high-resolution LIDAR elevation models (Figure 2). The LIDAR elevation model may be quite irregular or noisy, requiring smoothing of the elevation model or the alongshore inundation contours.\\n\\nIn approach #2, a historical shoreline analysis provides an erosion rate that is applied to the zero elevation contour. The historical shoreline analysis was performed using digitized shorelines extracted from historical aerial photographs and USGS T-sheets, following the method of Fletcher et. al. (2003). Annual Erosion Hazard Rates (AEHR) are determined using basis function methods following Frazer et. al. (accepted).\\n---\\n## Transect grid\\n\\n| |100|200|300|400|500|600|700|800|900|1000|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Maximum runup elevation|given by Stockdon (2006)|given by Stockdon (2006)|given by Stockdon (2006)|given by Stockdon (2006)|given by Stockdon (2006)|given by Stockdon (2006)|given by Stockdon (2006)|given by Stockdon (2006)|given by Stockdon (2006)|given by Stockdon (2006)|\\n\\nFigure 2 – The Waimanalo runup grid (A) and elevation (B) from a broad view. Beach profiles (E) are extracted from transects along shore-normal grid lines (C) where the elevation is given by a LIDAR survey (D).\\n\\nIn approach #3, a third generation spectral wave model, SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore – Booij et. al. 1999; Ris et. al. 1999), is run on nested grids (a 25 m grid extending to deep water and the 5 m nearshore grid – shown in Figure 3). The model is forced with parametric wave boundary conditions determined by the GEV distribution. Using SWAN, the spatial variability of the wave heights due to nearshore processes (including shoaling, refraction, convergence, divergence and breaking) can be resolved in the runup model.\\n---\\n## RESULTS\\n\\nExtreme wave statistics\\n\\nIntroduced by Jenkinson (1955), the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution uses Gumbel (type I), Frechet (type II), and Weibull (type III) distributions for different values of the shape parameter, κ = 0, κ < 0, κ > 0 respectively. Iterative maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) fit the observed data to find the best estimates of the shape (κ), scale (σ) and location (µ) parameters of the GEV cumulative distribution function, F(x), given by:\\n\\nF(x) = exp(-κ1(1 + κ(x - µ)/σ)) for κ ≠ 0\\nexp(-exp(-(x - µ)/σ)) for κ = 0\\n\\nBased on given probability distributions and the return period probability equation pTR = -1 r.i., wave height for a return period of interest is found. Northeast swell poses the greatest hazard to Waimanalo. The largest wave heights in Hawai‘i are experienced during northwest and north swell. Thus, in the recurring wave height analysis, buoy data is windowed to northeast swell directions (35-75o). The relationship between wave height and return period for Waimanalo is shown in Figure 4.\\n\\nExtreme Runup\\n\\nEmpirical equations give runup elevation in both RUNUP 2.0 and our approach.

Our approach uses a recently developed equation (Stockdon et. al. 2006) for the 2% exceedance runup:\\n\\n|R 2%|= < η > + S|\\n|---|---|\\n|R 2%|= 1.1 0.35( β f ( H L o ) + ( H L o ) ( 0.563 β f + 0.004 ) )|\\n\\nwhich similarly gives runup as a function of beach slope (foreshore slope β), deep-water wave height( H o ), and deep-water wavelength(L o ). We use the Stockdon formula because it is complete: it formulates runup as the sum of setup, < η >, and swash, S, due to both incident and infragravity energy. The relationship was derived from 10 datasets primarily from the continental US. To facilitate the comparison of each dataset, Stockdon computed reverse shoaling of wave heights measured in intermediate depths (~8 m) to back calculate the deep-water wave height. Reverse shoaling (using linear wave theory and assuming shore normal approach) is computed by dividing the nearshore wave height by the shoaling coefficient, K s = C g (deep water).\\n\\nThe previous relationship of wave height vs. return period is translated into runup vs. return period (shown in Figure 4), assuming a representative wave period of 16 sec. and a beach slope 1/24 (determined from a survey of Waimanalo).\\n\\n|Modeled IGFvI Year Wave 000 6.5 [m]|5-Year Wave 8.0 [m]|25 Year Wave 9.0 [m]|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Modeled X25-Year Runup 3.4 [m]|Year Runup lm|Year Runup 3.2 lm|\\n\\nFigure 4 - Return significant wave height [m] and return period [years] for Waimanalo for the northeast swell window 75-35o (Top) and corresponding return runup elevation [m] and return period [years] (Bottom) given by the Stockdon (2006) empirical runup relation using a nominal wave period of 16 sec. and a beach slope 1/24.\\n---\\n## Mapping Extreme Runup (Approach #1)\\n\\nFrom the known total runup level elevations, we can estimate the inundation contours for each return period and their inland migration due to sea-level rise (shown in Figure 5). It is important to keep in mind that approach #1 has no runup elevation variability. The inundation variability is only a function of the beach topography. The standard approach can be extended to account for runup variability as a function of a changing beach slope in the alongshore direction. However, when simply using the deep-water wave height in an empirical equation, the runup elevation is uniform in the alongshore direction. Using a wave transformation model will resolve this variability.\\n\\n|Sea-Level [m]|Sea-Level 0.25 [m]|\\n|---|---|\\n|Sea-Level - 0.5 [m]|Sea-Level [m]|\\n\\nFigure 5 - Illustrating approach #1 - inundation contours for different scenarios of sea-level rise (0, +0.25, +0.5, +1.0 m).\\n\\n## Mapping Extreme Runup and shoreline change (Approach #2)\\n\\nDepending on the dynamics of the shoreline, the inland migration of the return inundation levels rise may be considerably slower or be overtaken by recession of the shoreline due to erosional processes. In such a case, the erosion hazard will be greater than the inundation hazard to structures close to the coast. Waimanalo is not likely to have a significant erosion hazard, as it experiences very mild shoreline change rates (~1m/year accretion – 1m/year erosion). The case illustrated in Figure 6, shows the same inundation lines in approach #1 with a constant erosion rate of 0.6 m/yr to all transects.\\n---\\n## Figure 6 - Illustrating approach #2 - inundation contours for different scenarios of sea-level rise [0 (at present time), +0.25 (2025), +0.5 (2050), +1.0 m (2100)], and an eroded beach contour from a constant erosion rate of 0.6 m/yr.\\n\\nMapping Extreme Runup and nearshore wave processes (Approach #3)\\n\\nWaimanalo is fronted by a fringing reef that dissipates a significant amount of energy during large swell events. SWAN accounts for the dissipation over the fringing reef due to friction and breaking. Default parameters of friction (JONSWAP coefficient 0.067 m2 /s-3) and breaking parameters (α =1.0 & γ =0.85) are used.\\n\\nThe use of SWAN and reverse shoaling from intermediate depths on the reef (10, 15, 20 m) significantly reduces the projected wave heights and runup levels relative to the deep-water wave heights and runup levels. These results are illustrated in Figure 7 and quantified in Table 1.\\n---\\n## Figure 7 - Illustrating approach #3 - Projected inundation lines under a scenario of +0.25 m of sea-level rise with the runup computed from wave heights at different depths (5 m, 10 m, 15 m, and from deep water). The reverse shoaling and dissipation on the reef face is responsible for the significant reduction in runup and inundation at the coast.\\n\\n## Table 1 – Wave height and runup reduction over the fringing reef computed by SWAN and reverse shoaling.\\n\\n|Mean wave height computed by SWAN|Stockdon (2u061 paniculal dcpth coutours)|trow Wave helghts (lett anicular denth contours)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Depth|temunnetmc 1/an 'avenms Dento|Iya|\\n|Deen *1e|Deen-Yate 308| |\\n|Reduatiotita SWAN| | |\\n|Duzl|ruummfBridu Iara|Dept 102w2 25 YQ3i8|\\n|O.DOR|3734 073 029|6.0S 774 039|\\n|50.257 M5Y 757 06e5|26.765 26 72% 26,705 26.825| |\\n|Reductlon 17797 83047 93 B1%|LR,9206 48 T1s 422& 4a| |\\n|Dork|1uan| |\\n|Doen*1of Om Oms 0Dm?|0.6DC 1.789 033| |\\n|314 0.6DC| | |\\n|23469 40JX| | |\\n---\\n## DISCUSSION\\n\\nThe major problem with our approach and RUNUP 2.0 (used in the FIRMS) is the improper use of empirical equations. The use of empirical equations facilitates the speed of computation and the ability to determine runup elevations on regional scales. However, there is a tradeoff between speed and scale of computation. Full process-based numerical modeling requires extensive computational time and thus cannot be readily applied to regional scales. Empirical models can be applied on regional scales at the expense of inaccuracies on local scales.\\n\\nA major limitation of the application of empirical equations is the performance on a fringing reef. Empirical equations may perform quite well in predicting runup elevations in dynamically similar environments. On the other hand, they may perform quite poorly in dissimilar environments. One example of the potential problems that may result from use of empirical equations is the use of deep-water wave height to calculate runup. Using SWAN to predict the reduction in wave heights near or inside a fringing reef will account for the reduction in runup at the shoreline. Additionally, using SWAN rather than the individual transect method to compute the nearshore wave field, the spatial variability in wave height due to convergence and divergence is resolved. SWAN is able to compute wave setup inside a fringing reef. However, SWAN is not able to compute runup. Using a runup-resolving nearshore wave model would directly compute runup at the expense of computational speed and regional applicability. Nonetheless, the full process-based numerical modeling may be a considerably better approach.\\n\\nThe majority of the incident swell energy is reduced over dissipative beaches (mildly sloping beaches with wide surf zones) and fringing reefs, while infragravity motions dominate the sea level and runup signals at the shoreline (Guza & Thorton 1982; Ruessink 1998; Miles et. al. 2006; Kench & Brander 2006). Dissipation computed in SWAN and reverse shoaling significantly reduce the wave heights inside a fringing reef and corresponding runup elevations (as shown in Table 1). Outside the breaking point, reverse shoaling has a larger effect on reducing the wave height. Inside the breaking point, wave breaking is responsible for the largest reduction in wave height (50-83%), although reverse shoaling is responsible for an additional reduction (25-50%).\\n\\nOur goal of mapping extreme runup levels on nearshore topography has encountered many limitations in the field of runup prediction. However, as empirical equations are developed for several different geologic settings and nearshore process-based numerical models improve, the ability to map the extreme runup levels and determine the influence of sea-level rise will also improve.\\n\\n## CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nPractical approaches to mapping coastal inundation and the influence of sea-level rise can be quite informative, provided confident runup elevation estimates. The use of empirical equations in mapping runup elevations should be approached with caution, especially in fringing reef environments. The use of deep-water wave heights may significantly overestimate the runup at the shoreline. The use of nearshore wave models may improve the predictions of runup in fringing reef environments.\\n---\\nFollowing this approach we see that fringing reefs act as excellent natural breakwaters and may buffer adjacent coastlines against the short-term impacts of sea-level rise, particularly from the increase in frequency of wave-related inundation.\\n\\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n\\nThis paper is funded by a grant/cooperative agreement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Project # R/EP-26, which is sponsored by the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program, SOEST, under Institutional Grant No. NA05OAR4171048 from NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce.

The beach experiences dynamic seasonal shoreline change forced by longshore transport from two dominant swell regimes. In summer, south swells (Hs = 1-2 m Tp = 14-25 s) drive sand to the north, while in winter, north swells (Hs = 5-8 m Tp = 14-20 s) drive sand to the south where it accumulates on a submerged fossil reef. The Delft3D modeling system accurately predicts directly observed tidal currents and wave heights around West Maui, and is applied to simulate shoreline change. Morphologic simulations qualitatively resolve the observed seasonal behavior.\\n\\n## INTRODUCTION\\n\\nNumerical modeling allows for simulations of coastal behavior provided that physical processes involved in sediment transport and morphologic development are well\\n---\\nCoastal Sediments '07\\n\\n© 2007 ASCE\\n\\nresolved. Thus effort is needed to observe and, through modeling, reproduce wave and current fields with adequate spatial resolution.\\n\\nThe Delft3D modeling system accurately reproduces hydrodynamic behavior at a number of field sites (Elias et al. 2000; Klein et al. 2001; Luijendijk 2001; Walstra et al. 2001, 2003). Delft3D also reproduces observed sediment transport patterns in laboratory tests and morphologic simulations (Lesser 2000; Lesser et. al. 2004; Elias 2006) using the Van Rijn 1993 transport formulations. As an extension of these successes, it is hoped that adequate resolution of water levels, waves, and currents allow the model to reproduce sediment transport patterns in carbonate reef environments.\\n\\nKaanapali\\n\\nKaanapali Beach, located on the west coast of Maui, Hawaii, lies within a well-defined littoral cell extending 2 km south from Black Rock (a basalt headland) to Hanakao’o Point. Kaanapali Beach is at the center of the Maui Nui complex shown in Figure 1, which consists of the islands of Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and Kahoolawe. Shadowed by these islands, Kaanapali is exposed to direct swell from limited windows: north (350-10o), south (210-170o), west (280-260o), as well as refracted swell from the remaining directions.\\n\\n|Hawaiian Islands|Molokai|Maui Nui Co|West|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Lanai|Kaanapali|Maui|Maui|\\n| | | |Kahoolawe|\\n\\nLike the wave field, the Maui Nui current field is also spatially complex due to mean flows through the Pailolo Channel, which have been investigated in (Flament et al. 1996; Sun 1996; Storlazzi et al. 2006). Eversole (2003) characterized Kaanapali as an alongshore system that transports approximately 30,000 m3 of sand to the north during summer months driven by south swell, which later returns to the south in winter months forced by north swell. This volume of sand can result in dramatic beach width changes of more than 50 m.\\n\\nErosion Event\\n\\nIn early July 2003, Kaanapali experienced a rapid-onset erosion event that undermined resort landscaping and infrastructure landward of Hanakao’o Point. This event was likely the result of unusually high sea levels resulting from a series of\\n---\\n## Coastal Sediments '07\\n\\n© 2007 ASCE\\n\\nmesoscale eddies that arrived over spring and summer months as seasonal sea level increased due to water column warming. Mesoscale eddies, investigated in Firing et al. (2004), can persist for weeks to months and produce sea levels 15-20 cm above normal.\\n\\nThe Kahului tide station on Maui reached its highest recorded hourly water levels during the mesoscale eddy sequence of 2003. While 15-20 cm may seem like a small sea-level signal, in micro-tidal areas such as Hawaii (tide range = 0.6-0.8 m), these eddies represent a significant percentage of the tide range, and a significant increase on sandy shorelines otherwise exposed to nearly constant water levels. It is unlikely that the sea-level signal produced by these events would be able, by themselves, to cause significant erosion. However, when these coincide with spring tides and swell, the conditions for significant erosion exist. Mesoscale eddies are an episodic phenomenon today that represent a future permanent condition in coming decades due to eustatic sea-level rise on the order of 3 mm/year.\\n\\nSouth swell associated with the July eddy in 2003 reached a significant wave height of only 0.75 m at 10 m water depth (Tp = 15 s, breaking wave height = 1.3 m), which is considerably lower than the annually recurring deep-water significant wave height of 2 m (Tp = 17 sec, breaking wave height = 2 m). These factors emphasize the importance of sea level as a contributing factor to erosion, and seem to be a clear case of unprecedented water levels in combination with uneventful waves leading to unprecedented erosion.\\n\\nSeasonal Change\\n\\nSeasonal profile changes at Kaanapali beach are pronounced. Accretion periods can be idealized as two simple, different systems: accretion updrift of a headland (acting as a barrier to longshore transport, similar to a groin) and accretion on a flat fossil reef. Accretion updrift of a groin has been widely studied and is a common occurrence on coastlines in the US and abroad. The case of sand accretion on a perched beach is much less common, receiving only limited scientific attention.\\n\\nBeach widening at Hanakao’o Point during winter months is an acute example of accretion on a perched beach, and poses one of the most interesting questions presented by the dynamic cycle of accretion and erosion at Kaanapali. Accretion at Hanakao’o is much more concentrated and dramatic than at Black Rock, even though the north end has an obvious accretion mechanism in place: the physical barrier of Black Rock. It is likely that the shallow, rough reef at Hanakao’o slows southward propagating alongshore currents generated by north swell leading to bed deposition. Hanakao’o also marks the point where swell regimes change from surging breakers in the northern portion of the beach at Black Rock where swash transport may play an important role in beach morphology to offshore dissipative breakers on the reef (characterizing the southern portion of the beach). Because of the difference in offshore depth and wave breaking characteristics, Hanakao’o likely marks the termination of swash zone transport. Improving an understanding of the various\\n---\\n## Coastal Sediments '07\\n\\n© 2007 ASCE\\n\\nprocesses governing beach dynamics is critical to defining the role of eddy-generated water-level changes in episodic erosion.\\n\\n### METHODS\\n\\nData\\n\\nAn array of instruments shown in Figure 2 (including CTD/OBS and ADCP’s) was deployed at the 10 m depth contour along West Maui in 2003 as part of the USGS coral reef project to monitor physical processes affecting formation and lifespan of coral reef systems (Storlazzi et al., 2006). Another instrument (PUV) was deployed at Kaanapali in the summer of 2006 for further monitoring of waves and currents in shallow water.\\n\\nModeling\\n\\nThe Delft3D-FLOW module (v. 3.24.03 used here) solves the unsteady shallow-water equations with the hydrostatic and Boussinesq assumptions. In 2D mode the model solves two horizontal momentum equations (see Eq. 1-2), a continuity equation (Eq. 3) and a transport (advection-diffusion) equation (Eq. 4) shown below:\\n\\n∂ u/∂ t + u ∂ u/∂ x + v ∂ u/∂ y + g ∂ η/∂ x - fv + ρw(h + η) - ρw(h + η) - νe(∂ x^2 + ∂ y^2) = 0\\n∂ v/∂ t + u ∂ v/∂ x + v ∂ v/∂ y + g ∂ η/∂ y - fu + ρw(h + η) - ρw(h + η) - νe(∂ x^2 + ∂ y^2) = 0\\n∂η/∂ t + u ∂ h/∂ x + u ∂η/∂ x + v ∂ h/∂ y + v ∂η/∂ y = 0\\n∂[hc]/∂ t + ∂[huc]/∂ x + ∂[hvc]/∂ y = h[∂(∂c/DH)/∂x + ∂(∂c/DH)/∂y]\\n\\nwhere u and v = the horizontal velocities in the x and y directions respectively; t = time; g = gravity; η = free surface height; h = water depth; f = coriolis force; ρw = density of water; τ = bed friction; F = external forces due to wind and waves, νe = horizontal eddy viscosity; DH = horizontal eddy diffusivity; and c = concentration of suspended sediment. The equations are solved on a staggered finite difference grid using the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method after Stelling (1984).\\n\\nComputational Grids\\n\\nThe computations of Delft3D are performed on orthogonal curvelinear grids shown in Figure 2. Modeling for this project involves two flow grids: a regional model covering the West Maui coast and a local Kaanapali model. These grids are linked either by domain decomposition (DD) or interpolation of boundary conditions from the regional grid to the local grid. The use of DD models is very elegant, although primarily used here to validate the flow field in the smaller models, and justify the use of the local grid by itself. The use of just a local grid for simulations offers an\\n---\\n## Coastal Sediments '07\\n\\n© 2007 ASCE\\n\\nImprovement in computation time over domain decomposition models, especially if the single domain models return results similar to the DD models.\\n\\nADCP South Kahana (Airport)\\n\\nADCP Honokow\\n\\nCTDJOBS Black Rock\\n\\nPUV Janapal (2006)\\n\\nCTDIOBS Puamana\\n\\nFigure 2 - Instrument locations and grid layout.\\n\\n### Boundary Conditions\\n\\nWest Maui experiences a propagating tide, where gradient phases and amplitudes of tidal constituents exist along the coast, and tidal velocities are directed shore parallel (Storlazzi et al., 2006). Boundary conditions ideal for modeling this particular tidal configuration have been expressed in Roelvink and Walstra (2004), using water-level boundaries at the open (offshore) boundary and water-level gradient (Neumann) boundary conditions at lateral boundaries to solve for alongshore tidal velocities.\\n\\nThe boundaries use a harmonic forcing type, which facilitates use of the harmonic tidal components in water-level boundaries and determining water-level gradients. Water-level gradient boundary conditions can be determined simply from the amplitudes and phases of the tidal constitutes at each lateral boundary using the equations given in Roelvink and Walstra (2004):\\n\\nGiven tidal constituent Gradient amplitude:\\n\\n|Amplitude: η|Amplitude: η|\\n|---|---|\\n|north|south|\\n|η ⎛ φ i - φ i ⎞|η ⎛ φ i + π / 2 ⎞|\\n|i ⎜ ⎟|i ⎜ ⎟|\\n|⎝ d ts ⎠| |\\n|Phase: φ i|Phase: φ i + π / 2|\\n---\\n## Coastal Sediments '07\\n\\n© 2007 ASCE\\n\\nwhere η = amplitude of the tidal constituent (m); φ = phase of the tidal constituent\\n\\ni north south\\n\\n(φ, φ for north and south boundaries respectively (radians)) and d = distance\\n\\nts\\n\\nbetween the lateral boundaries (m). With these boundary conditions prescribed, the bed roughness is tuned to match the observed current magnitude. These boundary conditions have been shown to provide accurate simulations of tidal velocities in Roelvink and Walstra’s modeling studies (2004) at Egmond (Netherlands). This study provides another example of the excellent performance of boundary conditions developed from this scheme (see Results).\\n\\nThe wave boundary conditions are determined from model hindcasts (WaveWatch III) because there are no recorded buoy observations that include wave direction. These hindcasts adequately resolve observed wave heights and periods at a number of buoy locations in Hawaii. In this study, hindcast values of significant wave height, peak period and direction are applied uniformly at the open boundaries of the largest SWAN model, and a series of nested grids resolve the wave field down to the nearshore scale (10m grid) at West Maui and Kaanapali Beach. The SWAN nesting scheme is shown on Figure 3.\\n\\nFigure 3 - SWAN nesting scheme.

For regions influenced by mean flows and internal tides, more physical processes need to be accounted for to better resolve observed velocities. It appears the Honokowai station (Figure 4) is well resolved, while the South Kahana (Airport) station (Figure 5) is influenced by the presence of mean flows and internal tides. Despite the influence of unresolved processes, the models show good comparison with the observed flow velocities.\\n---\\n## Coastal Sediments '07\\n\\nMean flows observed at the South Kahana (Airport) Station appear to be related to wind direction, and may be related to island-trapped wave events (Merrifield 2002; Storlazzi 2006). Figure 9 shows the time series of wind speed and mean flow and their inter-relationship.\\n\\n| |AUG|time|Sep|Oct|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Wind speed [m/s]|Smoothed data|Linear RJN Data|Linear Smoothed Data| |\\n\\nFigure 9 - Relationship between winds and mean flow through the Pailolo Channel.\\n\\nWind speed and mean flow seem to mirror each other. A notable event in the time series is the decrease in wind speed in late July which leads to a corresponding decrease in the mean flow through the channel. Although the model accounts for wind forcing, the mean flow is not resolved. If the mean flow is due to wind forcing, the inability to resolve the mean flow is probably due to the limited coverage of the model domain: inability to develop significant wind-generated currents, and/or the topographic influence of West Maui which may cause local acceleration of the wind field.\\n\\nThe mean flow observed at South Kahana seems unlikely, from the two observed time series, to extend past the Honokowai station and potentially affect currents and sand transport at Kaanapali Beach. The major influence in sand transport at Kaanapali seems to be the wave-generated currents that arise from obliquely incident waves from north and south swell breaking on the westward-facing shoreline.\\n\\nWhile simulations of shoreline accretion and erosion forced by the dominant swell regimes show a qualitative morphologic behavior, the ultimate goal of modeling is to reproduce or predict transport volumes and resulting changes in the beach profile. Modeling beach profile changes often captures observed changes in mean state, but is\\n---\\nCoastal Sediments '07\\n\\n© 2007 ASCE\\n\\nless successful at predicting significant erosion and accretion events. While the model seems to perform adequately for scenarios on timescales of a few days, variability of wave and current conditions on longer timescales make simulations on timescales of months to years more difficult to resolve. Comparisons of observed and modeled profile changes, in Figure 10, show that the model tends to overpredict accretion (indicated by the frequency of records in quadrant 2 and above the perfect fit line) and to miss large erosion and accretion events in the end members of the littoral cell (Black Rock and Hanakao’o). Bias towards accretion is likely due to the persistence of small wave states during the 3-month simulation, and inability to resolve swell events that lead to significant change. The effects of 2D vs. 3D modeling on accretion predictions should also be investigated.\\n\\n|Modeled vs Observed morphologic change|03, V-del overpredicts accretion|01 Model performs Accretion|Location in Kaanapali littoral|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|03; Model overpredicts swell erosion|04 Model overpredicts erosion|Observed change|Figure 10 - Observed vs. modeled beach profile changes over 3 months at a number of locations at Kaanapali, Summer 2000.|\\n\\nAdditionally, there appears to be no significant difference in modeling the summer 2003 erosion event with and without the presence of the small sea-level signal contributed by mesoscale eddies. This is likely the result of discretization by the model. There is an inherent problem simulating natural processes using discrete numerical simulations, especially when variability of a particular process, in this case sea level in its vertical and horizontal position, exists on a smaller scale than the discrete grid is capable of resolving. Another process we are not effectively resolving in the model is the action of swash transport producing morphologic changes in the beach face. The model does, however, have a scheme to replicate morphologic beach face changes by applying a relative amount of erosion or accretion in wet grid cells to\\n\\n12\\n---\\nCoastal Sediments '07\\n\\n© 2007 ASCE\\n\\nadjacent dry grid cells. While this scheme is a practical solution to an extremely complex problem, it does leave a potentially important processes unresolved.\\n\\nWe can, however, make interesting conclusions about sand transport from simulations of simple scenarios. Morphologic simulations of transport due to north swell with a uniform bed roughness demonstrate transport of a considerable amount of sand around Hanakao’o Point. Increasing the simulated roughness for the submerged fossil reef offshore from Hanakao’o Point causes the sand to accumulate in this location. This is consistent with field observations.\\n\\nInability of the model to resolve the signal of the mesoscale eddy should not cause us to dismiss its influence. Simple Bruunian models assign sea-level position paramount influence, although the presence of reef surfaces may change this simple dynamic. It appears that increased sea level on a normal shoreline profile (not perched) may exist in unstable equilibrium until wave energy initiates transfer to a new position. The duration of mesoscale eddies is sufficient to begin this transition as evidenced by the considerable erosion observed in summer 2003 at Kaanapali. The event also suggests that increased sea-level signals may cause accelerated seasonal response in alongshore systems.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nRobust numerical models allow for realistic shoreline change simulations. Adequate observations are indispensable to ensure realistic performance. Poor modeling performance arises from inadequate tuning, unresolved processes, and spatial discretization of continuous natural processes. Use of water-level gradient boundary conditions given by observations of tidal components and the equations used in Roelvink and Walstra (2004) successfully model tidal velocities. Scenario-based modeling of seasonal shoreline change is qualitatively successful, whereas real-time, long-term simulations often to not capture significant changes in beach profile and shoreline position.\\n\\nMesoscale eddies and accretion on perched beaches atop rough reef substrates play a potentially significant role in beach morphology of Hawaiian shorelines, and merit continued investigation.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nThe authors would like to thank Edwin Elias, Dolan Eversole, Chris Conger, Jeff List, Capt.

Storlazzi 2\\n\\nPublished: xx xx xxxx\\n\\nGlobal climate change drives sea-level rise, increasing the frequency of coastal flooding. In most coastal regions, the amount of sea-level rise occurring over years to decades is significantly smaller than normal ocean-level fluctuations caused by tides, waves, and storm surge. However, even gradual sea-level rise can rapidly increase the frequency and severity of coastal flooding. So far, global-scale estimates of increased coastal flooding due to sea-level rise have not considered elevated water levels due to waves, and thus underestimate the potential impact. Here we use extreme value theory to combine sea-level projections with wave, tide, and storm surge models to estimate increases in coastal flooding on a continuous global scale. We find that regions with limited water-level variability, i.e., short-tailed flood-level distributions, located mainly in the Tropics, will experience the largest increases in flooding frequency. The 10 to 20 cm of sea-level rise expected no later than 2050 will more than double the frequency of extreme water-level events in the Tropics, impairing the developing economies of equatorial coastal cities and the habitability of low-lying Pacific island nations.\\n\\nGlobal sea level is currently rising at ~3–4 mm/yr1, 2 and is expected to accelerate due to ocean warming and land-based ice melt3, 4. Sea-level rise (SLR) projections range from 0.3 to 2.0 m by 2100, depending on methodology and emission scenarios5, 6, and recent work suggests that accepted methodologies significantly underestimate the contribution of Antarctica7.\\n\\nCoastal regions experience elevated water levels on an episodic basis due to wave setup and runup8, tides9, storm surge driven by wind stress and atmospheric pressure, contributions from seasonal and climatic cycles, e.g., El Niño/Southern Oscillation10, 11 and Pacific Decadal Oscillation12, and oceanic eddies13 (Fig. 1).\\n\\nCoastal flooding often occurs during extreme water-level events that result from simultaneous, combined contributions, such as large waves, storm surge, high tides, and mean sea-level anomalies11, 14.\\n\\nSLR leads to (1) passive high-tide inundation of low-lying coastal areas15, (2) increased frequency, severity, and duration of coastal flooding16, (3) increased beach erosion17, (4) groundwater inundation18, 19, (5) changes to wave dynamics20, and (6) displacement of communities21. Predicting regions vulnerable to passive inundation is relatively simple with the aid of high-resolution digital elevation models22. However, predicting the effect of SLR on episodic flooding events is difficult due to the unpredictable nature of coastal storms, nonlinear interactions of physical processes (e.g., tidal currents and waves), and variations in coastal geomorphology (e.g., sediments, bathymetry, topography, and bed friction). Local-scale assessments of coastal hazard vulnerability typically rely on detailed, computationally-onerous numerical modeling efforts23 in order to simulate wave-related nearshore water levels, interactions with local topography, and the resulting flooding. Global-scale coastal hazard vulnerability assessments, on the other hand, rely on extreme value theory applied to water-level observations.\\n\\nExtreme-value theory. Extreme-value theory24, 25 is a statistical method for quantifying the probability or return period of large events. The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, sometimes called the Fisher-Tippet distribution, is a powerful and general statistical model for extremes26 (Coles 2001). The GEV distribution models the probabilities of the maxima of a random variable24, 27, 28 using three parameters µ, σ, and k, the location (mean), scale (width), and shape (family type), respectively26.\\n\\n1University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60607, USA. 2US Geological Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Science Center, Santa Cruz, CA, 95060, USA. 3University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, 96822, USA.

As sea level increases, the probability increases that a fixed elevation will experience flooding (Fig. 2). Equivalently, the return period or recurrence interval of flooding at a fixed elevation decreases33, 34. In the example shown in Fig. 2B, 1 m of SLR causes the 5 m flood level (the former 100-year flood) to recur every 25 years.\\n\\nSLR can affect flood magnitude and frequency directly (Fig. 2) or indirectly via hydrodynamic feedbacks: SLR alters water depths, changing the generation, propagation, and interaction of waves, tides, and storm surges. Thus, SLR and long-term changes in wave climate, e.g., changes in magnitude, frequency, and tracks of storms35–37 and storm surge, can alter the parameters of extreme water-level distributions and the evolution of coastal hazards over time. In the proposed work, we assume parameter stationarity based on projections of minor changes (5–10%35–37) in mean annual wave conditions and storm surge over large regions of the ocean. In specific locations, such as the Pacific Northwest, trends in extreme wave climate may be significant38 and lead to a greater flooding hazard than SLR over at least the next several decades39, calling for nonstationary methods40 in future research.\\n\\nInvestigations of increased flooding frequency due to SLR are oft en site-specific and rely only on water-level data from tide stations. For example, Hunter (2012) [ref. 41] and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2013 report3 estimate the factor of increase in the frequency of flooding events due to 0.5 m of SLR at locations of 198 tide stations around the globe [Hunter41 Fig. 4 and IPCC3 Fig. 13.25]. Hunter41 and IPCC3 found that regions with low variability of extreme water levels will experience large increases in flooding frequency. This finding, introduced qualitatively by Hoozemans et al. [ref. 33], is critical to predict the global regions most vulnerable to SLR. However, global-scale coastal hazard assessments using this methodology encounter three challenges: (1) Water-level observation stations are sparsely located around the globe, especially in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic; (2) wave-driven water-level contributions, i.e., setup and swash, are not included;\\n---\\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\\n\\nGEV location parameter\\n\\n1.5\\n\\nGEV scale parameter\\n\\n[m]0.15\\n0.05\\n\\nGEV shape parameter\\n\\n-0.1\\n\\nFigure 3.

The dashed and solid lines in panel C represent contours of k that are significantly different from zero at the 75% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. The maps in this figure were made using Matlab 2016a (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/).\\n\\n(3) the global variability of the GEV shape parameter has not been considered, although it can be as influential as the scale parameter in determining vulnerability. Here we meet the three challenges by using extreme-value theory to combine sea level, wave, tide, and storm-surge models to predict increases in extreme water-level frequency on a global scale.\\n\\nApplication. Flooding results from the complex interaction of extreme water levels, topography, and the built environment. Here we use the frequency of extreme water levels as a proxy for regional-scale increases in flooding frequency, while recognizing that the relationship between water level and flooding is location dependent because of coastal topography, coastal defense structures, and drainage systems.\\n\\nWe apply sea-level projections and global wave, tide, and storm surge models to predict the future return periods (associated with the former 50-yr extreme water level) due to SLR. As in Hunter41 and IPCC3, we begin by investigating increases in flooding frequency due to a globally-uniform amount of SLR, acknowledging that spatial variability in the regional rate of SLR (e.g., driven by ocean circulation patterns, glacial fingerprinting) and the local relative rate of SLR (e.g., due to tectonic activity, glacial isostasy, land subsidence) will affect flooding predictions for specific locations42. Later we take the inverse approach, estimating the amount of SLR that doubles the frequency of extreme water-level events.\\n\\nUsing maximum likelihood estimates, we fit GEV probability distributions to the top three annual maximum water-level events from 1993–2013 obtained via synthesis of the Global Ocean Wave (GOW) reanalysis43, Mog2D storm-surge model44, and TPXO tide model45 as discussed in Methods. Figure 3 shows the global variability of the mean (µ), scale (σ), and shape (k) parameters for extreme total water level in panels A, B, and C, respectively. The GEV parameters provide necessary inputs to the factors of increase, finc, and the future return period of the former 50-yr water level based on Eq. (3) (see Methods). Figure 4 shows the factor of increase for the SLR projections µSL = +0.1, +0.25, +0.5 m on a global scale. Finally, the GEV parameters allow for global estimation of the amount of SLR that doubles the exceedance probability of the 50-yr water-level elevation [see Fig. 5 and Methods Eq. (4)]. Analyzing the amount of SLR leading to a doubling in flooding (Fig. 5) is equivalent to the\\n\\nScientific RepoRts | 7: 1399 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-01362-7\\n---\\nFigure 4.

Although the plotted distributions apply only to coasts, they are calculated ocean-wide in order to reveal the continuous global pattern of vulnerability of both continental coastal settings and non-contiguous island nations throughout the world’s oceans.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWe first consider the GEV parameters for extreme water levels (Fig. 3), then the frequency increases (Fig. 4), followed by the SLR threshold that doubles exceedance of the 50-yr water level (Fig. 5).\\n\\nThe spatial variability in the GEV location parameter (µ) is shown in Fig. 3A. Globally, 99% of the values of µ fall between 0.50 and 2.13 m. The location parameter strongly resembles the M2 tidal amplitude yet is also influenced by global wave climate. The parameter is largest in the North Pacific and North Atlantic due to large tides and the occurrence of extratropical storms that track mainly west to east, producing large, latitudinally-isolated waves. The scale parameter (σ) ranges from 0.024 to 0.118 m (Fig. 3B) and is correlated to the location parameter with r = 0.47. In other words, the regions that experience the largest water levels also experience the largest variance in those levels. The spatial variability of the shape parameter (k) is uncorrelated with that of the other GEV parameters.\\n\\nThe shape parameter ranges from -0.18 to 0.20 (Fig. 3C) with a global mean of -0.024. Notably, the geographic regions in Fig. 3C with large (positive) values of the shape parameter are regions with high densities of tropical storm tracks, i.e., the Tropics and lower mid-latitudes of the western Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The range and geographic variability of the shape parameter in Fig. 3C is remarkably similar to previously reported results for the shape parameter of extreme wave heights, underscoring the importance of wave-driven water-level components (See Extended Data Figs 3 and 8 for details) and the role of tropical cyclones on the magnitude and spatial distribution of the shape parameter.\\n\\nIn theory, negative values of the shape parameter, i.e., bounded water-level distributions, are expected based on the notion that upper bounds on tide, storm surge, and maximum wave heights exist due to limiting processes (e.g., wave breaking and physical limits in wind speed, fetch, and duration prevent unbounded wave heights). On the other hand, positive values of the shape parameter, i.e., unbounded water-level distributions, indicate the probability of exceedingly large yet inconsistent water-level events relative to an annual event. In practice, both positive and negative values of the shape parameter are possible because of the limited amount of data available for parameter estimation and the possibility of outliers. Thus, it is difficult to assess, a priori, whether the large values of the shape parameter result from a proper characterization of the variability of tropical cyclones or from the presence of outliers among a temporally-limited data set. We expect that more than 21 years of data (used here) would likely improve the characterization of extreme events due to tropical cyclones and the estimation of the shape parameter.\\n\\nThe dashed and solid lines in panel C (Fig. 3) represent contours of k that are significantly different from zero at the 75% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. The near-zero mean and the limited extent of the statistically significant non-zero values of the shape parameter in Fig. 3C suggests that the Gumbel distribution [the GEV family when k = 0, as in Hunter and IPCC] might suffice for global-scale assessments of SLR impacts. However,\\n\\nScientific RepoRts | 7: 1399 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-01362-7\\n---\\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\\n\\nfor smaller-scale regions of interest, particularly the Caribbean Sea, the Central North Pacific, and North Atlantic, the variability of the shape parameter should be accounted for when predicting the effects of SLR.\\n\\nNext, we discuss how the global GEV parameters characterize the increased frequency of flooding due to SLR (Figs 4 and 5). Although the behavior of the scale parameter is well known [as introduced by Hoozemans et al.33, and further explored in Hunter41 and IPCC3], these figures provide the first continuous, global demonstration of that behavior, as well as the first incorporation of wave-driven water levels.\\n\\nThe factor of increase in frequency of the 50-yr extreme water-level event, finc, and the future return period of the former 50-yr extreme water level due to SLR, 50 f - 1, are shown in Fig. 4. For fixed SLR, decreasing values of the scale and shape parameters increase finc and thus reduce the return period of the present 50-yr water level. The increase in finc is larger in the Tropics (white lines on Fig. 4) compared to the Extratropics. The results presented in Fig. 4 and Table 1 indicate that the average factor of increase in flooding, finc, in the Tropics with only 10 cm of SLR is approximately 25 times present levels, and the former 50-yr event occurs every 4.9 years. Outside the Tropics, the average factor of increase is 5.5, and the former 50-yr event occurs every 10.9 years. Note that the results given in Table 1 do not exactly follow the reciprocal relationship between the increase in frequency (finc) and the reduction in return period (50 f - 1) because of the spatial averaging operation. Finally, we note that the estimated increase in flooding potential is purely due to SLR and not due to possible future changes in wave climate or storm patterns.\\n\\nThe upper bound of the doubling SLR, µ2x, (Fig. 5) is estimated as the upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals of the GEV parameter estimates using Eq. (4) in Methods. As shown in Fig. 5, only 5–10 cm of SLR, expected under most projections to occur between 2030 and 2050, doubles the flooding frequency in many regions, particularly in the Tropics, and would occur even more rapidly in areas where regional SLR exceeds the eustatic rate12. Less than 5 cm of SLR doubles the frequency of the 50-yr water level in the tropical Atlantic and northwestern Indian Ocean. The maps of increased flooding potential (Figs 4 and 5) suggest a dire future for the top 20 cities (by GDP) vulnerable to coastal flooding due to SLR, and for many wave-exposed cities such as Mumbai, Kochi, Grande Vitoria, and Abidjan which may be significantly affected by only 5 cm of SLR. Less than 10 cm of SLR doubles the flooding potential over much of the Indian Ocean, the south Atlantic, and the tropical Pacific. Only 10 cm of SLR doubles the flooding potential in high-latitude regions with small shape parameters, notably the North American west coast (including the major population centers Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles), and the European Atlantic coast. The only regions where 15 cm of SLR does not double the flooding potential are regions with large shape parameters (likely influenced by tropical storm tracks): the mid-latitudes of the northwestern Pacific below Japan, the mid-latitudes of the northwestern Atlantic (the U.S. east coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea), and the southwest tropical Pacific encompassing Fiji and New Caledonia (discussed below).\\n\\nThe Tropics experience limited water-level variance due to consistently smaller wave heights (due to latitudinal gradients in storm activity) and smaller tide ranges (due to the presence of tidal amphidromes) throughout the region. Consequently, SLR represents a larger percentage of the water-level variance as explained in Fig. 2 and Methods. The mid-latitudes of the northwestern Pacific and the northwestern Atlantic experience smaller increases in extreme water-level frequency due to large values of the scale and shape parameter, respectively. Notably, the mid-latitudes of the northwestern Pacific below Japan experience large values of the scale parameter without correspondingly large values of the location parameter as in most of the north Pacific and north Atlantic, possibly due to the consistency of tropical storms in the region. The mid-latitudes of the northwestern Atlantic (e.g., the U.S. east coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea), on the other hand, have elevated values of the shape parameter due to the intermittent occurrence of tropical cyclones, which correspond to elevated probabilities of large extremes rather than bounded extremes. This suggests that although the continued and accelerating impacts of SLR-driven nuisance flooding is a major concern in many of these areas, the rare occurrence of extreme events (e.g., hurricanes) – and not SLR – will remain the dominant hazard on wave-exposed coastlines in the lower mid-latitudes of the western Pacific and Atlantic for several decades.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nRegions with limited variability in extreme water levels, such as the Tropics, will experience greater increases in flooding frequency due to SLR than regions with significant water-level variability, e.g., the Extratropics. Small amounts of SLR, e.g., 5–10 cm, may more than double the frequency of extreme water-level events in the Tropics as early as 2030. This is an especially critical finding as numerous low-lying island nations in the Tropics are particularly vulnerable to flooding from storms today, and a significant increase in flooding frequency with climate change will further challenge the very existence and sustainability of these coastal communities across the globe.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nGeneralized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is given by\\n\\n|F x( ; µ, σ, , k )|⎧ - µ - 1/k|⎪ - (1 + ( ))|⎪ e k x σ for k ≠ 0|⎪|⎨ x- µ|⎪ -e -( σ )|⎪ e for k = 0|⎪|⎩|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | | | | | | | | | |\\n\\nwhere F is the probability that water level x will not be exceeded in any one-year period, and µ, σ, and k are the location, scale, and shape parameters, respectively. The GEV distribution includes as special cases three families of extreme value distributions: Gumbel (type I), Fréchet (type II) and Weibull (type III), corresponding to values of the shape parameter k = 0, k > 0, and k < 0, respectively. Depending on the value of the shape parameter, k, the support of F(x) is either the entire real axis when k = 0 or {x: 1 + k x( - µ σ)/ > 0} when k ≠ 0. From Eq. (1), the exceedance probability distribution, i.e., the probability that water level x is exceeded in any one-year interval,\\n\\nScientific RepoRts | 7: 1399 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-01362-7\\n---\\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\\n\\nE = 1−F. Thus E(x) is the expected frequency (with units of years−1) of events exceeding x. The return period, TR, or expected time-interval between events of level x or greater is therefore T = ExR 1/(), with units of years. For example, a 100-year event has an exceedance probability of 0.01, that is, a 1% chance of occurring in any year. Although return period carries exactly the same information as exceedance probability, it is often more intuitive.\\n\\nThe factor of increase in exceedance probability for SLR µSL > 0 relative to a baseline (µSL > 0) is given by finc (x; µµ, SL, σ, k) = (; Ex µσ SL, k , ), and the factor of decrease in return period is −1. For example, for the 50-yr event, Tx µσ k = years, hence the future return period of the former 50-yr water-level elevation is f − 1 as shown in Fig. 4B,D and F.\\n\\nFinally, we reframe the extreme value analysis to determine the amount of SLR leading to a doubling in 50 inc exceedance of a particular water-level elevation. Note that in Fig. 2, the SLR leading to a 4x increase in probability of the former 100-yr event (e.g., the 25-yr event with +1.0 m of SLR), is simply the difference between the 100-yr water level, xT = µσ k , and the 25-yr water level, , of the unaltered distribution. ( 100; , , ) xT = µσ k Thus, the doubling SLR is given by (R 25; , , ) µT = xT µσ k − x ( 1 T µσ k 2x ( R ) ( R ; , , ) 2 R ; , , )\\n\\nFor the example shown in Fig. 5, we use TR = 50 years. Note that the magnitude of µ2x in Eq. (4) and Fig. 5 is controlled by the gradient of the return time function x(TR), as explained in Fig. 2B, and that that gradient is controlled by the scale and shape parameters. For low-gradient return time functions, the difference in x for the 50 and 25-yr return times is small, and in Fig. 5 the gradient is low for all levels exceeding that of the 10-yr event. Application. Well-validated global tide45, wave43, and storm surge44 reanalysis models, each with different spatial and temporal resolutions, are interpolated onto a consistent 1° × 1° grid with hourly time resolution and their water-level components are summed to provide a time series of total water level (TWL). In the proposed approach, we ignore mean sea-level anomalies (MSLA) due to seasonal effects and climate cycles (e.g., El Niño), which, for example, can raise sea level by more than 20 cm along the US west coast11, yet are typically less than 20 cm over much of the globe. Large-scale storm surge due to extratropical storms is included in the analysis, but the coarse resolution of the water-level model44 precludes simulation of large, spatially isolated hurricane storm surge. On the other hand, the wave fields emanating from hurricanes and tropical cyclones have considerably larger spatial extents and, therefore, are well resolved by the wave model43 apart from the near-field generation regions. We limit the time scales considered in our investigation due to the availability of only 21 years of coincident data for waves, tides, and storm surge: extrapolation of 21 years of data to predict 100-year and longer return period events is often problematic.\\n\\nHourly time series of tidal water level are computed from 13 harmonic constituents provided by the TPXO tidal inversion model45 with native resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° linearly interpolated onto a global grid of 1° × 1°. Time series of wave setup are estimated using the empirical relationship for the 2% exceedance runup on dissipative beaches8 R = . H L setup 0 016 0 0 , where H0 and L0 are the deep-water wave height and wavelength, respectively. We exclude wave swash, the time-varying components of wave runup at incident and infragravity frequencies, because of the large uncertainties associated with the estimation of swash magnitude. For example, wave swash is sensitive to local geological characteristics, notably the beach slope. Wave swash is a time-dependent process, which may or may not affect persistent flood levels. In certain locations, wave swash can significantly contribute to persistent coastal flooding via overtopping of seawalls. Therefore, we include the contribution of wave swash to TWL in Extended Data Figures 5, 6 and 7, which depict the same analyses shown in Figs 3, 4 and 5 (which do not include wave swash). In Extended Data Figures 5, 6 and 7, the magnitude of the 2% exceedance wave swash is estimated using the empirical relationship for dissipative beaches8 given by R = . H L swash 0 027 0 0 , which is approximately 1.69 times larger than the wave setup component, Eq. (5). We note that dissipative beach conditions are assumed for the wave runup components in Eqs (5) and (6) in order to avoid the dependence on beach slope.\\n\\nTime series of H0 and wave period (T) are obtained via the hourly 1° × 1.5° Global Ocean Wave (GOW) reanalysis43, and linearly interpolated onto a 1° × 1° grid. The time series of wavelength L0 = gT2/(2π) is calculated using linear wave theory from the time series of wave period. Time series of storm surge are obtained from the Mog2D barotropic model44 with native resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° at 6-hour intervals, interpolated to an hourly dataset with 1° × 1° resolution. The resulting hourly time series of wave setup, storm surge, and tidal water level for each 1° × 1° grid cell are summed to produce an hourly time series of total water level from 1993–2013. Nonlinear interactions between tide, surge, and wave-driven water levels are not accounted for using this approach. However, processes such as tide-surge interactions may be important in coastal regions around the globe, particularly those adjacent to continental shelves or shallow bathymetry49. In general, tides provide the\\n\\nScientific RepoRts | 7: 1399 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-01362-7 7\\n---\\n## www.nature.com/scientificreports/\\n\\ndominant contribution (51% on average) to the total water level (see Extended Data Fig. 3). However, when wave swash is included, wave runup (i.e., wave setup + wave swash) provides the dominant contribution (66% on average) to the total water level (see Extended Data Fig. 8).\\n\\nNext, GEV distributions are fitted to the top three (r = 3) annual maxima (n = 63) of the 21-year time series of total water level at each grid point to obtain spatially-varying estimates of the parameters µ, σ, and k. This approach, called the r-largest order statistic model, is consistent with the GEV distribution for block maxima26. To avoid the case where the r-highest values were taken from successive hours, a minimum peak separation criterion of 12 hours was applied. This criterion ensures that the block maxima are independent as required by the r-largest order statistic model26. The spatial variability of the GEV parameters is smoothed using a penalized least-squares method50. Data on the GEV parameter estimates and confidence intervals are available online (see “GEV_data.xlsx”). The GEV parameters µ, σ, and k control the factor of increase finc and the future 50-yr return period 50 f − 1 based on Eq. (3), for different values of SLR and event level x. Here we set x to be the 50-yr inc water-level event; however the behavior is consistent across a range of extreme values for x, particularly those exceeding the 10-yr water level as noted above. Finally, we calculate the sea-level rise, µ2x, that doubles the exceedance of the former 50-yr water-level elevation based on Eq. (4). To account for the uncertainty in the GEV parameter estimates, a Monte Carlo simulation with 100,000 realizations is applied for each grid point. Each realization generates random values of µ, σ, and k based on the 95% confidence intervals arising from the maximum likelihood estimates and applies Eq. (4) to calculate µ2x. Next, the upper bound of the doubling sea level (Fig. 5) is calculated as the 95% cumulative probability (%5 exceedance probability) for the empirical distribution of µ2x. Figure 5 shows the upper end of the 95% confidence level for the SLR that will double (or more than double) the frequency of the 50-yr water-level event.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n|1.|Watson, C.

(Also available at http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2011/1051.)\\n---\\n## Executive Summary\\n\\nBeach erosion is a chronic problem along most open-ocean shores of the United States. As coastal populations expand and community infrastructure comes under increasing threat from erosion, there is a demand for accurate information about trends and rates of shoreline movement, as well as a need for a comprehensive analysis of shoreline movement that is consistent from one coastal region to another. To meet these national needs, the U.S. Geological Survey began an analysis to document historical shoreline change along open-ocean sandy shores of the conterminous United States and parts of Hawaii and Alaska. An additional purpose of this work is to develop systematic methodology for mapping and analyzing shoreline movement so that consistent periodic updates regarding coastal erosion can be made nationally.\\n\\nThis report on shoreline change on three of the eight main Hawaii islands (Kauai, Oahu, and Maui) is one in a series of reports on shoreline change in coastal regions of the United States that currently include California, the Gulf of Mexico region, the Southeast Atlantic Coast, and the Northeast Atlantic Coast. The report summarizes the methods of analysis, documents and interprets the results, explains historical trends and rates of change, and describes the response of various communities to coastal erosion. Shoreline change in Hawaii was evaluated by comparing historical shorelines derived from topographic surveys and processed vertical aerial photography over time. The historical shorelines generally represent the past century (early 1900s–2000s). Linear regression was used to calculate rates of change with the single-transect method: long-term rates were calculated from all shorelines (from the early 1900s to the most recent), whereas short-term rates were calculated from post-World War II shorelines only.\\n\\nBeach erosion is the dominant trend of shoreline change in Hawaii. However, shoreline change is highly variable along Hawaii beaches with cells of erosion and accretion typically separated by only a few hundred meters on continuous beaches or by short headlands that divide the coast into many small embayments. The beaches of Kauai, Oahu, and Maui are eroding at an average long-term rate for all transects (shoreline measurement locations) of -0.11 ± 0.01 m/yr (meters per year) and an average short-term rate of -0.06 ± 0.01 m/yr. The majority, or 70 percent, of transects on the three islands indicate a trend of erosion in the long term and 63 percent indicate a trend of erosion in the short term. A total of 22 kilometers of beach, or 9 percent of the total length of beach studied, was completely lost to erosion over the past century. Annual erosion is greatest on Maui with an average long-term shoreline change rate of -0.17 ± 0.01 m/yr and erosion at 85 percent of transects. Short-term analysis for Maui indicates a similar erosional trend with an average rate of -0.15 ± 0.01 m/yr and erosion at 76 percent of transects. Nearly 7 kilometers (11 percent) of beach was completely lost to erosion in the analysis period on Maui. Annual erosion for all transects on Kauai is intermediate in the long term, with an average rate of -0.11 ± 0.01 m/yr and erosion at 71 percent of transects. The short-term average rate for Kauai (0.02 ± 0.02 m/yr) suggests stable or accreting beaches; though, the majority (57 percent) of transects indicate a trend of erosion. Six kilometers or 8 percent of Kauai beaches were completely lost to erosion in the analysis period. Oahu beaches are the least erosional of the three islands in the long term; though, erosion is still the dominant trend of shoreline change with an average long-term rate of -0.06 ± 0.01 m/yr and erosion at 60 percent of transects. Shoreline change trends on Oahu beaches are roughly the same in the short term as in the long term with an average rate of -0.05 ± 0.01 m/yr and erosion at 58 percent of transects. The single-transect method of rate calculation indicates that erosion rates are statistically significant (95-percent confidence interval) at 30 percent of transects in the long term and 22 percent of transects in the short term.\\n---\\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\\n---\\n|Contents|Page 1|\\n|---|---|\\n|Introduction| |\\n|U.S. Geological Survey National Assessment of Shoreline Change|Page 1|\\n|The Role of

Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\nBy Charles H. Fletcher1, Bradley M. Romine1, Ayesha S. Genz1, Matthew M. Barbee1, Matthew Dyer1, Tiffany R. Anderson1, S. Chyn Lim1, Sean Vitousek1, Christopher Bochicchio1, and Bruce M. Richmond2\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nU.S. Geological Survey National Assessment of Shoreline Change\\n\\nSandy beaches of the United States are some of the most popular tourist and recreational destinations. Coastal property constitutes some of the most valuable real estate in the country. Beaches are an ephemeral environment between water and land with unique and fragile natural ecosystems that have evolved in equilibrium with the ever-changing winds, waves, and water levels. Beachfront lands are the site of intense residential and commercial development even though they are highly vulnerable to several natural hazards, including marine inundation, flooding and drainage problems, effects of storms, sea-level rise, and coastal erosion. Because the U.S. population continues to shift toward the coast where valuable coastal property is vulnerable to erosion, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is conducting a national assessment of coastal change. One aspect of this effort, the National Assessment of Shoreline Change, uses shoreline position as a proxy for coastal change because shoreline position is one of the most commonly monitored indicators of environmental change. Additionally, the National Research Council recommended the use of historical shoreline analysis in the absence of a widely accepted model of shoreline change.\\n\\nA principal purpose of the USGS shoreline change research is to develop a common methodology so that shoreline change analyses for the continental U.S., portions of Hawaii, and Alaska can be updated periodically in a consistent and systematic manner. The primary objectives of this study were to (1) develop and implement improved methods of assessing and monitoring shoreline movement, and (2) improve current understanding of the processes controlling shoreline movement.\\n\\n1University of Hawaii.\\n\\n2U.S. Geological Survey Pacific Coastal & Marine Science Center.\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\nThe Role of State and Federal Governments\\n\\nOne reason for conducting this national assessment of shoreline change is that there is no widely accepted, standardized method of analyzing shoreline change. Each state has its own data needs and coastal-zone management responsibilities (for example, construction set-back lines, dune protection zones, and public access) and, therefore, each state uses a different technique and standard to compile shorelines and calculate rates of shoreline movement. Consequently, calculated rates of shoreline change and projected erosion hazard zones are inconsistent from state to state and often cannot be compared directly. These inconsistencies were clearly demonstrated by the FEMA-sponsored erosion studies (Crowell and Leatherman, 1999) that were used as the basis for evaluating erosion hazards (The H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics, and the Environment, 2000).\\n\\nSeveral Federal agencies (U.S. Geological Survey, USGS; Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA; and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, USACE) have regulatory or administrative responsibilities pertaining to shorelines. These responsibilities are different, however, and require different approaches. They also offer substantial opportunities for cooperation. For example, the USACE is authorized and funded by Congress to report on the economic and environmental implications of shoreline change and the costs of erosion mitigation. Its National Shoreline Management Study (Stauble and Brumbaugh, 2003) is being conducted using existing shoreline data. The USGS shares data and information, such as the lidar-derived shoreline and rates of change, in support of that effort. NOAA has a mandate to establish the official shoreline boundary for the nation using tidal datums. Its emphasis is on safe navigation and using the shoreline to generate nautical charts. NOAA also conducts the VDatum program, which assists agencies in delineating shorelines for a variety of purposes. Congress authorized and funded FEMA to report on the economic impact of erosion hazards on coastal communities, and on claims to the National Flood Insurance Fund. To accomplish this goal, FEMA contracted with state agencies and academic researchers to conduct a pilot study of erosion hazards that included shoreline change data for limited geographic areas (Coyne and others, 1999). The USGS is responsible for conducting research pertaining to coastal change hazards, understanding the processes that cause coastal change, and developing models to predict future change. The USGS is the only government agency that has a dedicated program to monitor coastal change into the future using consistent methods nationwide. This program is critically important for the assessment of national issues such as the coastal impacts of sea-level rise.\\n---\\n## Environmental Framework of the Hawaiian Shoreline\\n\\nSince the work of Dolan and others (1985), methods of obtaining, analyzing, displaying, and storing shoreline data have improved substantially, and coastal change has continued. Furthermore, coastal scientists have not agreed on standard methods for analyzing and reporting shoreline change, nor have they identified rigorous mathematical tests that are widely accepted for quantifying the change and associated errors. Consequently, there are critical needs for (1) a nationwide compilation of reliable shoreline data, including the most recent shoreline position; and (2) an improvement in methods for obtaining and comparing shoreline positions and mathematically analyzing trends in shoreline movement.\\n\\nThe past half-million years of geologic history has been characterized by the occurrence of dramatic swings in global climate approximately every 100,000 years. Oscillating between cold episodes (glacial periods, or ice ages) and warm intervals (interglacial periods), climate changes have caused global sea level to rise and fall over a range of approximately 130 m. During interglacial periods, sea level is high and reefs are constructed on the island margins. Because sea level reaches different heights in successive glacial cycles, the carbonate history of Hawaii is complex.\\n\\nThe insular shelf is constructed from multiple carbonate units representing reef accretion and erosion over recent glacial cycles. Specifically, the shallow shelf is a fossil reef complex dating from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7 (about 190,000–210,000 years ago; Sherman and others, 1999; Grossman and Fletcher, 2004). The front of this shelf accreted separately during MIS 5a–d (about 80,000–110,000 years ago). Eolianites (lithified dunes) of late last interglacial (about 80,000 years ago) and Holocene (about 10,000 years ago to present) age are found in the nearshore and coastal plain regions of most of the islands. Most modern Holocene reef accretion is limited to environments on the deeper front of the reef, where wave energy is not destructive. Grossman and Fletcher (2004), Conger and others (2006a), and Bochicchio and others (2009) infer that rugosity in depths less than 10 m atop the fringing reef is largely the result of karstification of limestone, not reef accretion, during times of lower sea level, most recently since the last interglacial period. Modern wave scour has prevented accretion in this zone. At depths greater than 10 m, the karst surface may be overgrown by Holocene accretion where wave energy permits.\\n\\n### Environmental Framework of the Hawaiian Shoreline\\n\\nThe Hawaii hotspot lies in the mantle under, or just south of, the “Big Island” of Hawaii where it feeds magma to two active subaerial volcanoes (Mauna Loa and Kilauea) and one active submarine volcano (Loihi). Centrally located on the Pacific plate, the hotspot is the source of the Hawaii Island Archipelago and its northern arm, the Emperor Seamount Chain.\\n\\nThe main Hawaiian Islands are built of shield volcanoes composed of basaltic lavas, intrusive dike complexes, and tephra deposits. Valley floors between volcanoes and coastal plains surrounding them consist of alluvial sediments eroded from the interior and carbonate deposits around the shoreline. The geology of most coastlines in Hawaii is characterized by outcropping volcanic bedrock, lithified tephra, and carbonate deposits (eolianite, beach rock, unconsolidated carbonate sand, and reef rock). Unconsolidated calcareous and clastic sediment, eroded from either the offshore reef or upland sources or directly produced by calcareous marine organisms, collects along the shore to form narrow beaches relative to continental siliciclastic beaches.\\n\\n### Carbonate Geology\\n\\nBecause Hawaii’s white sand beaches are derived from fringing reefs, beach origin and history are intimately connected to the geologic framework of reefs. The fossil reefs of Oahu have been the subject of several studies that are reviewed by Fletcher and others (2008). Offshore of island beaches, the insular shelf typically dips gently seaward to near the -20-m contour. There, a limestone dropoff marks the end of the shallow portion of the shelf in most places. The base of this wall is typically found at a depth near -30 m, where a deeper, partially sand-covered terrace extends seaward to approximately -50 m. Below -50 m, a second wall and third terrace are found.\\n\\nHawaiian reef morphology exerts a strong control on shoreline sediment supply and dynamics. Dollar (1982) and Dollar and Tribble (1993) identified physical disturbance from waves as the most important factor determining the structure of Hawaiian coral reef communities. Expanding on this work, Grigg (1983) articulated the “intermediate disturbance hypothesis” and presented two models of coral community succession: (1) an undisturbed (lack of wave impact) community that reaches peak diversity as a result of recruitment followed by a reduction due to competition; and (2) a disturbed community where diversity is set back to zero in the case of a large disturbance, or diversity is ultimately increased in the case of intermediate disturbance (substrate is opened for new recruitment).\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\n| |120° E|140° E|160° E|180°|160° W|140° W|120° W|100° W|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|60° N| | | | | | | | |\\n|40° N| | | | | | | | |\\n|20° N| | | | | | | | |\\n|Kauai| |Oahu| |Molokai|Maui|Lanai|Kahoolawe| |\\n|Niihau| | | | | | | | |\\n\\nEXPLANATION\\n\\n9\\n\\n5\\n\\n1\\n\\n3\\n\\nElevation, in kilometers\\n\\nEmperor\\n\\nSeamounts\\n\\nHawaii\\n\\nArchipelago\\n\\n| |0|1,000 Kilometers|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |0|1,000 Miles|\\n\\n-11\\n\\n-9\\n\\n-7\\n\\n-5\\n\\n-3\\n\\n-1\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\nBase (top) from ETOPO2v2 computer-generated global relief model\\n\\n(2-minute latitude/longitude grid, Cylindrical Equidistant projection):\\n\\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2006 (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/2minrelief.html);\\n\\n(bottom) from Hawaiian multibeam bathymetry synthesis computer-generated relief model\\n\\n(version 18, 0.0005-degree latitude/longitude grid, WGS 1984),\\n\\nHawaii Mapping Research Group, 2011 (http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HMRG/multibeam/index.php).\\n\\nFigure 1.

In their work along the south shore of the island of Molokai, Engels and others (2004) developed a community zonation model related to wave-generated bed shear stress as modeled by Storlazzi and others (2002). Engels and others (2004) define three assemblages: low, mid, and high energy. The zonation model relates bed shear stress to percent living coral cover, relative percent coralline algae cover, dominant coral species, dominant coral morphologies, and water depth. Each assemblage is divided into three depth zones: less than 5 m, 5 to 10 m, and greater than 10 m. All observed coral types that account for at least 10 percent of living coral cover are represented in the model.\\n\\nModern reef communities in wave-exposed settings are suppressed to a veneer (Grigg, 1998). North Pacific winter swell produces the largest and most frequently damaging energy, yet waves of greatest magnitude and impact are likely to occur only rarely and are associated most often with strong El Niño years (for example, 1998) perhaps a decade or more apart (Rooney and others, 2004). Intervening coral growth able to survive the strong annual pounding by waves may be wiped out by these interannual waves of extraordinary size and energy. Radiocarbon dates of fossil corals show that coral growth in wave-exposed settings has been continually suppressed since about 5,000 years ago on northern exposed coasts (Rooney and others, 2004) and about 3,000 years ago on southern shorelines (Grossman and others, 2006).\\n\\n## Beach Sediments\\n\\nEffective, sustainable management of Hawaiian beach systems requires an understanding of sediment production, as many beaches are losing sediment with time (eroding). Hawaiian beach sands are derived primarily from calcareous debris eroded from the insular reef shelf, which is reworked into sand-size grains by breaking waves on the reef shelf and at the shoreline. Hawaiian beach sands are, on average, medium in size (classification of Wentworth (1922)) (Inman, 1952; Dunbar and Rodger, 1957), though the sediment on individual beaches can range in size from coarse to fine sand. Moberly and Chamberlain’s (1964) analysis of littoral sediment grain size around the Hawaiian Islands shows that grain size is closely related to wave and current energy, which in Hawaii is strongly related to shoreline aspect.\\n\\n**Table 1.

These high-energy wave conditions are short lived so that new sediments are not highly abraded or sorted. Strong surf generated on western and northern coasts by winter North Pacific swell leads to coarse-grained beaches, as sediments are abraded only during a portion of the year. In general, the grain-size diameter of sand on all beaches tends to be finer in the summer months (June to September) and coarser in the winter months (November to March).\\n\\nBeach and reef morphology is similarly dependent on shoreline aspect. Beaches on north- and west-facing shorelines tend to be the longest and widest, whereas reefs tend to be narrower, deeper, and more irregular. North- and west-facing beaches transition from wide and gently sloping in summer to steep and narrow in winter, as sand is moved seaward.\\n\\nLacking a continental source, sand in the Hawaiian Islands is often highly calcareous with a smaller contribution from eroded volcanic rock. The volcanic component of beach sediments is typically controlled by the bedrock geology adjacent to the shoreline. The light color of most Hawaiian beaches results from the dominance of grains from fragmented marine invertebrate animals and algae.\\n\\nThe composition of many Hawaiian beaches is dominated by larger species of foraminifera, followed by mollusks, red algae, and echinoids. Coral fragments constitute only a small fraction. Foraminifera in beach sand are thought to result more from their durability in wave action rather than from their ecological abundance.\\n\\nIn contrast to island-wide surveys of beach sands, a more detailed study of sand composition in Kailua Bay, windward Oahu, found that more than 90 percent of sand grains were biogenic carbonate dominated by skeletal fragments of coralline algae followed by calcareous green algae, coral fragments, mollusk fragments, and benthic foraminifera.\\n\\nRadiocarbon age of carbonate sands has been used as an indicator of longevity, production rate, and transport of coastal sediments. Dates measured for Hawaiian coral and skeletal fragments show that sediment is produced, transported, and lost from the coastal system on a millennial scale.\\n\\n|Content|Page Number|\\n|---|---|\\n|Environmental Framework of the Hawaiian Shoreline|7|\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\nEXPLANATION\\n\\n|Depth range, in meters|2,919 All sediment|1,482 Excluding Kailua|3,819 channel sediment|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|0-10| | | |\\n|10-20|119| | |\\n|20-30|42| | |\\n\\nFigure 4. Volume of sediment by depth zone in Kailua Bay, Oahu. (Location shown in figure 26) (Modified from Bochicchio and others, 2009)\\n\\nSediment trapping on the reef surface keeps sand potentially available for circulation within a littoral cell rather than allowing it to be lost to offshore sites (Grossman and others, 2006). Most sediment in reef systems is produced on the shallow nearshore platform, where carbonate productivity and erosion are highest. Sediment remains on the reef platform in storage or as part of the active littoral system unless it is transported seaward of the reef crest and insular shelf (Harney and Fletcher, 2003). Once sediment crosses this threshold, the comparatively steep angle of the forereef slope likely prevents most shoreward transport, effectively removing sediment from littoral circulation unless it moves back into shallow water through paleochannels cut into the reef (Grossman and others, 2006). On many islands, steep submarine terraces more than 20 m deep exacerbate sediment loss by presenting a seaward-facing sharp break in topography (Coulbourn and others, 1974). In some cases, large channels are incised perpendicular to the shoreline and through the reef crest, creating a potential pathway for sediment exchange between inner and outer portions of the reef platform (Grossman and others, 2006).\\n\\nThe majority of reef-top depressions are relict features incised into the surface of Hawaiian reef platforms through dissolution or fluvial erosion during periods of lower sea level, when subaerially exposed limestone is in contact with meteoric waters (Purdy, 1974). The resulting channel and doline karst landscape is drowned by rising sea level and subsequently filled with sediment, unless depressions are filled by new reef accretion (Grigg, 1998; Grossman and Fletcher, 2004; Rooney and others, 2004; Conger, 2005; Grossman and others, 2006). Most shallow reef-top sediment storage (deposition) occurs in depressions that likely are eroded during periodic subaerial exposures of fossilized reefal limestone.\\n\\nTherefore, the potential for modern sediment storage is, to some degree, a function of pre-Holocene erosion (increasing storage space) and post-Holocene reef accretion infilled eroded features (reducing storage space).\\n\\nSea Level\\n\\nLocal relative sea level around Hawaii (fig. 6) is not only dependent on the global eustatic average trend (a rise of about 3 mm/yr (millimeters per year); Merrifield and others, 2009) but also is affected by local oceanographic patterns, basin-scale meteorology, and localized flexure of the oceanic lithosphere, which responds elastically to the heavy load of volcanic rocks over the Hawaiian hotspot. It is estimated that one half of the upward construction of Hawaiian volcanoes is lost to subsidence and that most of the volcanoes have subsided 2 to 4 kilometers (km) since emerging above sea level (Moore, 1987). Subsidence associated with active volcanism causes upward plate flexure at a radius that correlates to the modern-day position of Oahu. Oahu, as evidenced by the presence of emerged fossil reefs, is undergoing long-term geologic uplift; however, the rate of uplift is less than 1 percent of the rate of sea-level rise.\\n\\nSea level has risen around Hawaii approximately 1.5 mm/yr over the past century. Although this rate may seem small, long-term sea-level rise can lead to chronic coastal erosion, coastal flooding, and drainage problems, all of which\\n---\\n## Environmental Framework of the Hawaiian Shoreline\\n\\n|21°|158°15\\' W|158°00\\'|157°45\\'|N|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|45\\'|N| | | |\\n| |Kailua Bay| | |(no data)|\\n|21°| | | |(no data)|\\n| |Oahu| | | |\\n|30\\'|Oahu| | |Sand-filled paleochannel|\\n|21°| | | | |\\n|15\\'| | | |Kailua Bay|\\n\\nEXPLANATION\\n\\n|Sand Depth, in meters|0|\\n|---|---|\\n| |35|\\n\\nFigure 5.

(Modified from Conger and others, 2009)\\n\\nCoastal erosion, although not solely tied to climate change, is an important factor in managing the problem of rising sea level. Sea-level rise accelerates and expands erosion, potentially affecting beaches that previously were stable. Chronic erosion seaward of developed lands has historically led to seawall construction, resulting in beach loss (Fletcher and others, 1997).\\n\\nAlthough the rate of global mean sea-level rise has approximately doubled since 1990, sea level not only did not rise everywhere, but actually declined in some large areas (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2011). The pattern of global sea-level change is complex because sea level is affected by winds and ocean currents, which also are changing. In Hawaii, improving our understanding of the effects of sea-level change requires attention to local variability with careful monitoring and improved modeling efforts.\\n\\nClimate change is expected to cause sea-level rise to continue, and accelerate, for several centuries; and may exceed 1 m above the 1990 level by the end of the 21st century (Fletcher, 2009b; Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009). Continued sea-level rise will increase marine inundation of coastal roads and communities. Saltwater intrusion will intensify in coastal wetlands, groundwater systems, estuaries, and elsewhere. Extreme tides already (2012) cause drainage problems in developed areas.\\n\\nSea-level rise threatens Hawaiian beaches (fig. 7), tourism, quality of life, and infrastructure. Hawaiian communities located at the intersection of intensifying storm runoff and rising ocean waters will likely experience increased flooding.\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\n| |A.

The storminess of the North Pacific reaches a peak in the boreal winter, as the Aleutian low intensifies and the North Pacific high moves southward. Strong winds associated with these storms produce large swells, which can travel for thousands of miles until reaching the shores of Hawaii. In summer months, the North Pacific high moves northward and storms in the North Pacific become infrequent. Satellite-derived average wave heights over the North Pacific in winter and summer are shown in figure 9. The average winter wave heights in the North Pacific are about 3 m or greater, whereas summer wave heights are about 2 m or less. Although figure 9 gives the average state of the North Pacific, individual storm events in this dynamic system typically track eastward with wave heights on the order of 5 to 10 m. These swell-producing storms occur during winter months with typical reoccurrence intervals of 1 to 1.5 weeks (for 5- to 7-m swells), 2 to 3 weeks (for 7- to 9-m swells), and 1 month (for swells 9 m high or greater).\\n\\nMany North Pacific storms do not produce swells that reach Hawaii. Storms that originate in high latitudes and those that track to the northeast send swells to the Aleutian Islands and the Pacific Northwest. Swells that originate from storms in lower latitudes and those that track slightly to the southeast reach Hawaii with the largest wave heights. Hawaii receives its largest swell from the North Pacific, with an annually recurring maximum deep-water significant (average of the highest third of the waves) wave height of 7.7 m with peak periods of 14 to 18 seconds. However, the size and number of swell events in Hawaii vary each year by a factor of 2. The annual maximum wave height recorded at buoy 51001 ranges from about 6.8 m (in 1994, 1997, and 2001) to 12.3 m (in 1988).\\n\\nThe seasonal cycle of North Pacific swell peaks in winter with a daily average wave height about 4 m. Aucan (2006) depicted the monthly average directional spectra from buoy data at Waimea (buoy 51201) and Mokapu (buoy 510202) that showed the dominance of North Pacific swell out of the northwest in winter months, and relatively persistent energy out of the northeast in higher frequency bands associated with trade wind swell.\\n\\n|Summer|Winter|EXPLANATION|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|3.5|3|Average wave height, in meters|\\n|2.5|2| |\\n|1.5|1| |\\n|0.5|0| |\\n\\nFigure 9.

This plot shows the seasonal variability of North Pacific Ocean swell, which begins to increase in October, reaches a peak in winter, decreases in March, and reaches a minimum in summer.\\n\\nOccurring about 75 percent of the year, the trade winds are northeasterly (average, 73°) winds with an average speed of 25 kilometers per hour (16 miles per hour). Anticyclonic flow around the North Pacific high bolsters the trade winds in Hawaii in summer months, increasing their persistence. In winter months, the North Pacific high flattens and moves closer to the islands, decreasing the trade wind persistence. Although the number of days characterized by trade winds is greater in summer than in winter months, mean trade wind speed in summer and winter months is similar.\\n\\n5\\n\\n|Number of days| | |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|4| | |\\n|3| | |\\n|2| | |\\n|1| | |\\n|0| | |\\n\\nWind speed, in kilometers per hour\\n\\n### EXPLANATION\\n\\nSummer (June, July, Aug)\\n\\nWinter (Dec, Jan, Feb)\\n\\nFigure 11.

Strong Kona storms generate wave heights of 3 to 4 m with periods of 8 to 11 seconds, along with wind and rain, and can cause extensive damage to south- and west-facing shores (Rooney and Fletcher, 2005).\\n\\nMinor Kona storms occur nearly every year in Hawaii, however, major Kona storms resulting in substantial shoreline change tend to occur every 5 to 10 years, during the negative PDO cycle (Rooney and Fletcher, 2005). Consequently, positive (warm) PDO and El Niño phases tend to suppress Kona storm activity (Rooney and Fletcher, 2005).\\n\\nAlthough each wave regime (trade wind swell, North Pacific swell, southern swell, and Kona storms) has its own underlying processes and mechanics, the sum of all of these regimes contributes to the wave heights and shoreline change in Hawaii. Breaking waves at the shoreline are composed of swell sources from many different storms and swell regimes.\\n\\nThe most common combination of swell modes for north-facing shores is North Pacific swell and trade wind swell. The most common combination of swell modes for south-facing shores is southern swell and trade wind swell. Thus, the spectral approach to swell and surf patterns following Aucan (2006) is an informative way of depicting the Hawaiian wave climate.\\n\\n## Shoreline Change\\n\\nAll the processes considered thus far influence beach morphology in Hawaii. Morphologic changes include seasonal beach profile changes, extreme events, and chronic trends. Seasonal beach-profile changes result from the seasonal variability of the Hawaiian wave cycle.\\n\\nIn winter months, north-facing shorelines are exposed to increased wave activity from the North Pacific swell. In summer months, south-facing shorelines are exposed to increased wave activity from the southern swell. This wave activity is associated with increased run-up and increased impacts to the beach and coastal dunes. Elevated energy at the shoreline transports sand offshore or alongshore with dominant currents. The beach profile remains in an adjusted state until wave heights decrease or swell patterns change to allow the displaced volume of sand to return. A conceptual example of cross-shore sand transport and profile change is shown in figure 12.\\n\\n## Tides\\n\\nThe tide range in Hawaii is comparatively small, typically 0.58 m (Mean Higher High Water (MHHW)—Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW)), and the spring tide range is about 1 m. Although the astronomic tide typically represents the largest water-level variability at a particular location, other factors such as atmospheric pressure, wind setup, ENSO cycles, and oceanic disturbances can produce water-level variability on the order of tens of centimeters. One important process influencing extreme sea-level events in Hawaii is the occurrence of mesoscale eddies, which are large (greater than 100 km) oceanic disturbances with elevated sea levels of about 15 cm (Firing and Merrifield, 2004).\\n\\nAs discussed previously, many sources contribute to the maximum water level on a beach, including tide, wave setup, wave run-up, and other sources of water-level variability. Coincidence of large swell and tide events can cause severe coastal flooding and overtopping in Hawaii, whereas swell events that occur at low tides or neap cycles typically are less severe (Caldwell and others, 2009).\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\nchanges that do not show a cyclical pattern.

Time series of shoreline positions can be used to document coastal change and are interpreted to improve our understanding of shoreline stability.\\n\\nCompilation of Historical Shorelines\\n\\nThe most commonly used sources of historical shoreline data have traditionally been NOAA’s National Ocean Service (NOS) Topographic sheets (T-sheets; Shalowitz, 1964) and vertical aerial photographs. Ideally, extraction of past shoreline positions from these data sources involves georeferencing and removing distortions from maps and aerial photographs, followed by digitizing the shoreline position.\\n\\nDepending on location, data source, and scientific preference, different proxies are used to represent the position of the shoreline. Common shoreline proxies include the high water line (HWL) (Shalowitz, 1964); a wet-dry line (maximum run-up; Moore and others, 2006); the first line of vegetation (for example, Hwang, 1981); the toe or crest of the abutting dune (Moore and Griggs, 2002); a low water line such as the toe of the beach (for example, Fletcher and others, 2003); a cliff base or top (for example, Hapke and Reid, 2007); and a tidal datum or elevation—typically the location where the plane of mean high water (MHW) intersects the beach face (for example, Morton and others, 2004).\\n\\nIn this study, the methods of Fletcher and others (2003) and Romine and others (2009) for mapping historical shorelines were followed closely. Historical shorelines were digitized from NOS T-sheets and orthorectified aerial photomosaics with spatial resolution (pixel size) of 0.5 m.\\n\\nExtreme beach profile changes, whose magnitude exceeds typical seasonal levels, result from extreme swell, storm, and sea-level events often associated with a corresponding ENSO or PDO cycle. Examples of extreme beach changes in Hawaii include the erosion that has occurred (2005–present) at Kailua Beach Park near the boat ramp during persistent windy conditions (La Niña), followed by the short-lived return of sand associated with the low wind (El Niño) conditions of winter 2009/2010. As the El Niño ended and La Niña winds returned, the sand at Kailua again disappeared, and erosion has dominated since. Another example of extreme beach fluctuations occurred in 2003 at Kaanapali Beach, Maui, as a result of the combination of high water levels caused by a mesoscale eddy juxtaposed with spring high tide, late summer heating, and a modest southern-swell event (Vitousek and others, 2007).\\n\\nOne of the main goals of this study was to quantify the extent of long-term or “chronic” erosion on Hawaiian shorelines. Chronic changes are long-term (decades to centuries).\\n---\\n## Methods of Analyzing Shoreline Change\\n\\nEXPLANATION\\n\\nHistorical shoreline\\n\\n- January, 1928\\n- Topographic sheet,1932\\n- September, 1949\\n- October, 1958\\n- April, 1967\\n- March, 1971\\n- March, 1975\\n- February, 1988\\n- July, 1996\\n- June, 2006\\n\\nFigure 13.

For some T-sheets produced before 1930 additional coordinate transformation information from NOAA was required to convert the data from the United States Standard Datum (USSD) to the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27). The datum transformation was applied to T-sheet graticule coordinates prior to rectification. Total RMS error for the rectification process was maintained below 1 pixel, which is approximately 4 m at a scale of 1:20,000 and approximately 1.5 m at a scale of 1:10,000. The resulting RMS error typically was much lower than 1 pixel.\\n\\nTo verify T-sheets and datum transformations, shoreline features that change little over the period of study (for example, rock headlands and engineered structures) were used. In the Hawaiian Islands, the adoption of the NAD 27 datum for mapping and the emergence of several unsupported local and island-specific datums have led to confusion among cartographers and surveyors. Many T-sheet products used in this study were re-rectified to correct substantial errors associated with incorrect projection datum definitions. Such errors otherwise would have rendered the sheets unusable.\\n\\nNewly georeferenced T-sheets were loaded in ESRI (http://www.esri.com/) ArcGIS software and ArcToolBox was used to transform the T-sheets into the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) prior to shoreline digitization. A verification of the T-sheet shoreline was carried out where possible using control marks or physical shoreline features that are present on the T-sheet by comparing them with a reliable current image. Where verification failed, T-sheets were re-rectified using ground control points on existing control stations and identifiable shoreline features. In all cases, shoreline-feature verification produced a high-quality data product.\\n\\n## Mapping Historical Shorelines\\n\\nIn Hawaii, the high reflectivity of Hawaiian white carbonate beaches reduces the visibility of the HWL on historical aerial photographs (Fletcher and others, 2003). Norcross and others (2002) and Eversole and Fletcher (2003) found that the low water mark (LWM) or toe of the beach was important as a pivot point for cross-shore and alongshore sediment-transport processes at their study sites at Kailua Beach, Oahu, and Kaanapali Beach, Maui, respectively. Excellent water clarity\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\nRelative to most continental beaches allows the delineation of Table 3. Range of errors in position of historical shorelines for the LWM on historical aerial photomosaics, which is distinguished by a black and white or color tonal change at the base of the foreshore, most easily identified by the relative position of wave run-up on the beach.\\n\\n|Source of error|Maui|Oahu|Kauai|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Seasonal error (E s)|± 1.2–7.1|± 3.6–6.2|± 2.5–19.9|\\n|Tidal error (E td)|± 1.4|± 2.5–3.4|± 2–6|\\n|T-sheet conversion error (E c)|± 1.9–7.5|± 3.4–5.7|± 1.0–13.8|\\n|Digitizing error (E d)|± 0.8–5.1|± 0.5–5.7|± 0.8–9.7|\\n|Pixel error (E p)|± 0.5|± 0.5|± 0.5–3.41|\\n|Rectification error (Er)|± 0.1–6.1|± 0.6–3.0|± 0.0–7.3|\\n|T-sheet plotting error (E ts)|± 5.1|± 5.1|± 5.1|\\n\\nPositional uncertainties, including errors related to seasons, tides, and T-sheet HWL-to-LWM shoreline conversions, are related to all phenomena that reduce the precision and accuracy of defining a shoreline position in a given year. These uncertainties center mostly on the nature of the shoreline position at the time an aerial photo is taken.\\n\\nSeasonal error (E s) is the error associated with movements in shoreline position from waves and storms. In Hawaii, this movement is largely a seasonal process, with swell from the North Pacific in winter and South Pacific in summer. Some beaches tend to accrete in summer and erode in winter, whereas other beaches tend to do the opposite as a result of seasonal shifts in predominant swell direction.\\n\\nBecause seasonal change is cyclical, the probability of a photograph depicting a summer shoreline is equal to the probability of a photograph depicting a winter shoreline. Therefore, a uniform distribution is an adequate approximation of seasonal uncertainty. Seasonal differences in shoreline position (LWM) were quantified from summer and winter beach profile measurements at a study beach or nearby beach with similar littoral characteristics.\\n\\nIf available, seasonal shoreline positions from aerial photographs taken in adjacent seasons can be used in place of beach profile data. The mean and standard deviation of seasonal changes were calculated from the absolute values of differences between summer and winter.\\n\\n## Uncertainty and Error\\n\\nSeveral sources of error affect the accuracy of historical shoreline positions and final shoreline change rates. In this report, two types of uncertainty are defined: positional uncertainty and measurement uncertainty. Following methods in the study of Romine and others (2009), and building on work by Fletcher and others (2003), Genz and others (2007a), Morton and others (2004), and Rooney and others (2003), seven different sources of error in identifying shoreline positions on aerial photographs and T-sheets (three positional and four measurement errors) were quantified. The seven sources of error are summed in quadrature (the square root of the sum of the squares) to arrive at a total positional uncertainty (U t). The range of values of each type of error for each island are listed in table 3.\\n---\\n## Methods of Analyzing Shoreline Change\\n\\nand winter shoreline positions. A uniform distribution was generated (with MatLab rand function) that incorporates the mean and two times the standard deviation as minimum and maximum values. The standard deviation of the distribution is the seasonal error.\\n\\nTidal fluctuation error (Etd) is the error from horizontal movement in shoreline position along a beach profile due to vertical tides. Aerial photographs were obtained without regard to tidal cycles, which can influence the position of the digitized shoreline. The horizontal movement of the LWM during a spring tidal cycle was monitored on several beaches to assess this error. Because the tides cyclically fluctuate between low and high, a photograph can capture the shoreline at any tidal stage. Therefore, like seasonal error, a uniform distribution is an adequate approximation of tidal uncertainty. A uniform distribution is generated that incorporates the mean and two times the standard deviation as minimum and maximum values. The tidal error is the standard deviation of the distribution.\\n\\nConversion error (Ec) is calculated only for T-sheets and is the error associated with migration of T-sheet HWL shorelines to a LWM position. The error is the standard deviation of the differences between the offset and HWL-to-LWM beach profile measurements.\\n\\nMeasurement uncertainties, including errors related to shoreline digitization, image resolution, image rectification, and T-sheet plotting, are related to analyst manipulation of the map and photo products. For T-sheets, National Map Accuracy Standards (U.S. Bureau of the Budget, 1947) were adopted that provide a measure of both position and measurement uncertainties. For photos, measurement uncertainty is related to the orthorectification process and onscreen delineation of the shoreline.\\n\\nDigitizing error (Ed) is the error associated with digitizing the shoreline. One analyst digitizes the shorelines for all photographs and T-sheets to eliminate the possibility of different interpretations by multiple analysts. The error is the standard deviation of the differences (distances) between repeated digitizations by several analysts. The error is calculated for photos/T-sheets at different resolutions.\\n\\nPixel error (Ep) is the pixel size of the image. The pixel size in orthorectified images is 0.5 m, which means that any feature smaller than 0.5 m cannot be resolved. The pixel size in T-sheets is 1.0 to 3.0 m.\\n\\nRectification error (Er) is calculated from the orthorectification process. Aerial photographs are corrected, or rectified, to reduce displacements caused by lens distortions, refraction, camera tilt, and terrain relief using PCI Orthoengine. The RMS values calculated by the software are measures of the offset between points on a photo and established GCPs. The rectification error is the RMS value.\\n\\nT-sheet plotting error (Ets) is calculated only for T-sheets. The error is based on the analysis of topographic surveys by Shalowitz (1964). Three major errors are involved in the following accuracy of T-sheet surveys: (1) measured distance has an accuracy of 1 m, (2) planetable plotting has an accuracy of 3 m, and (3) delineation of the HWL on the beach has an accuracy of 4 m. The three errors are summed in quadrature to obtain the T-sheet plotting error.\\n\\nThese errors are random and uncorrelated and can be represented by a single measure calculated by summing in quadrature, (equation 1). The total positional uncertainty (Ut) is\\n\\nU t = ± Es + Etd + Ec + Ed + Ep + Er + Ets (1)\\n\\nFor aerial photographs, Ec and Ets are omitted. For T-sheets, Etd is omitted. Ut is used as the accuracy attribute field for each shoreline year. These uncertainty values can be propagated into the shoreline change result using weighted linear regression (or weighted least squares, WLS) in the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) (Thieler and others, 2009). The resulting uncertainty in the rate incorporates the uncertainty in each shoreline and the uncertainty in the rate-determining model.\\n\\n## Calculation and Presentation of Rates of Change\\n\\nRates of shoreline change were generated in ArcGIS with DSAS version 4, an ArcMap extension developed by the USGS (Thieler and others, 2009). DSAS employs the single-transect method (ST) to calculate change rates and rate uncertainties at regularly spaced transects (measurement locations) alongshore. ST uses various methods (for example, end point rate, least squares, weighted least squares) to fit a trend line to the time series of historical shoreline positions at a transect.\\n\\nTransects were spaced approximately at 20-m intervals alongshore, roughly perpendicular to the trend of the shoreline. Hawaiian beaches are typically narrower and shorter than mainland beaches. To adequately characterize change on Hawaiian beaches, the transect spacing used was narrower than that typically employed in studies of mainland U.S. beaches (for example, 50 m; Morton and others, 2004; Morton and Miller, 2005).\\n\\nShoreline change rates were calculated with ST using WLS regression, which accounts for uncertainty in each shoreline position when calculating a trend line. The weight for each shoreline position is the inverse of the uncertainty squared (for example, wi = 1/Ui^2). Shoreline positions with higher uncertainty have less influence on the trend line than data points with smaller uncertainty. The slope of the line is the shoreline change rate (fig. 14).\\n\\nRates were calculated for long- and short-term shoreline data. All shorelines were used for long-term rate calculations, and post-WWII shorelines were used for short-term rate calculations. A minimum of three historical shoreline positions\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\nRate = -0.4 ± 0.1 meters per year\\n\\nShoreline position, in meters\\n0\\n-50\\n\\n1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 2010\\n\\nEXPLANATION\\n\\nShoreline position with 95-percent confidence interval\\n\\nRegression line\\n\\nFigure 14.

Transects with less than three shoreline intersections are given a \\'null\\' rate and are not included in calculating regionally averaged rates. In some instances, the beach disappeared over the course of the study period. In these cases, rates were calculated using only shorelines up to and including the first shoreline indicating no beach. The total extent of beach lost in a region is estimated by multiplying the number of transects where the beach was lost times 20 m (20-m transect spacing). The percent of beach lost in a region is the number of transects where the beach was lost divided by the total number of transects.\\n\\nHistorical shoreline data typically are sparse (commonly less than 10 shorelines) and noisy (high positional uncertainty). Consequently, shoreline change rates tend to have high uncertainty, resulting in many rates that are not statistically significant. For this study, an insignificant rate was defined as a rate that is indistinguishable from a rate of 0 m/yr; in other words, the calculated ± rate uncertainty overlaps 0 m/yr. Rates that are statistically insignificant still provide coastal managers with a most likely scenario of shoreline change—valuable information for assessing the risk of future shoreline erosion. Reducing the uncertainty in shoreline change rates using improved statistical methods will assist coastal managers in making more informed, science-based decisions when planning for future erosion hazards.\\n\\nRegionally averaged shoreline change rates are the average of rates from all transects in a coastal region.

Kauai is more than 5 million years old and has a roughly circular shape as a result of at least one, and perhaps two, shield volcanoes. More than 1.5 million years after the primary shield-building stage had ceased, rejuvenated volcanism (the\\n---\\n## Historical Shoreline Change Analysis\\n\\nKoloa Volcanic Series) began resurfacing two thirds of the eastern side of the island. Kauai has approximately 75 km of sandy beach that is separated into four regions: north, east, south, and west (Figure 15).\\n\\nFrom 3 to 11 historical shorelines with dates ranging from 1926 to 2008 are available for Kauai (table 4). The 1927 shoreline is derived from a T-sheet and the 1930 shoreline is from a hydrographic chart. All other shorelines are derived from vertical aerial photographs.\\n\\nErosion is the general long-term trend of Kauai beaches (table 5). During the analysis period, 6.1 km or 8 percent of the total extent of Kauai beaches was lost to erosion. The average of long-term rates for all Kauai transects is -0.11 ± 0.01 m/yr and 71 percent of transects indicate a trend of erosion. The short-term average rate for Kauai suggests stable or accreting beaches at 0.02 ± 0.02 m/yr. However, the majority (57 percent) of transects still indicate a trend of erosion in the short term. Overall reduced erosion in the short term for Kauai beaches is due largely to a change in average rates along West Kauai from erosion in the long term to accretion in the short term. The minimum and maximum long-term shoreline change rates on Kauai are measured near Koki Point in South Kauai (erosion, -1.5 ± 0.4 m/yr) and at Major’s Bay in West Kauai (accretion, 1.6 ± 1.8 m/yr) (table 6). The maximum short-term change rates are measured at Lawai Bay in South Kauai (erosion, -1.7 ± 9.9 m/yr) and at Polihale in West Kauai (accretion, 2.8 ± 6.2 m/yr). The rate at Lawai is associated with a high degree of uncertainty because the beach was lost to erosion and a truncated data set was used to calculate the rate up to the time the beach disappeared. The rate at Polihale is associated with a high degree of uncertainty as a result of seasonal variability.\\n\\n|159°45\\' W|159°30\\'|159°15\\'|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|160 °W|158 °|156 °|\\n|22 °|Kauai|Hawaiian|\\n|N|Oahu|Islands|\\n| |Maui|Pacific Ocean|\\n|21°|Pacific Ocean|North|\\n|45\\'| | |\\n|20 °N| | |\\n|0|100 KILOMETERS| |\\n|0|100 MILES| |\\n|22°|West| |\\n|00\\'|N| |\\n| | | |\\n|Base from National Elevation Dataset (1/3 arc-second grid, NAD83), U.S. Geological Survey, 2009.|0 2.5 5 KILOMETERS| |\\n| |0 2.5 5 MILES| |\\n\\nFigure 15.

The maximum long-term erosion rate (-0.7 ± 0.6 m/yr) was found immediately west of Haena Point. Other locations with significant long-term erosion rates include Moloaa (up to -0.4 ± 0.2 m/yr) and Anini (up to -0.4 ± 0.1 m/yr). The maximum long-term accretion rate (0.7 ± 0.7 m/yr) was found near the middle of the 3.5-km-long crescent-shaped beach at Hanalei, which is accreting along most of its length. The Hanalei subregion is a notable exception to the predominant trend of erosion along North Kauai. The beach at Hanalei Bay is accreting at an average long-term rate of 0.11 ± 0.03 m/yr, whereas the Kilauea and Haena subregions are eroding at -0.13 ± 0.03 m/yr and -0.23 ± 0.03 m/yr, respectively (table 7).\\n\\nIn North Kauai, the average short-term rate (-0.06 ± 0.02 m/yr) indicates less erosion than the average long-term rate. Sixty percent of transects are erosional in the short term—a 16-percent decrease from the long-term rate. As with the long-term analysis, Hanalei is the largest exception to the overall trend of short-term erosion along North Kauai. The maximum short-term erosion rate (-1.0 ± 2.6 m/yr) was found at a rocky outcrop at Kauapea (table 6). This section of beach is susceptible to seasonal changes in shoreline position, as indicated by the high associated uncertainty. The maximum accretion rate (0.8 ± 1.5 m/yr) was measured at Kahili Beach near Kilauea Stream mouth. This beach is also highly unstable as a result of seasonal fluctuations in shoreline position from large waves and stream flow.

The East region consists of three subregions. For the 867 transects, 34 percent of long-term rates and 16 percent of short-term rates are significant. The average long-term rate is -0.15 ± 0.02 m/yr, the most erosional rate of the four Kauai regions. Seventy-eight percent of transects are erosional in the long term. East Kauai has the lowest percentage of accreting transects (19 percent) of the four Kauai regions. The maximum long-term erosion rate (-0.7 ± 0.4 m/yr) was measured at the western end of Aliomanu Beach. Other areas of significant long-term erosion are found at Nukolii (up to -0.5 ± 0.3 m/yr) and north of Waipouli (up to -0.3 ± 0.2 m/yr). At Kapaa, erosion rates as high as -0.9 m/yr were found along a short extent (transects 493–500) where beach appeared intermittently and was ultimately lost to erosion (coastal armoring).\\n\\nThe maximum long-term accretion rate (0.7 ± 0.4 m/yr) was measured at Anahola Beach, south of Anahola River. All subregions of East Kauai are erosional in the long and short term. The Kapaa subregion is the most erosional of the three, with an average long-term rate of -0.17 ± 0.02 and an average short-term rate of -0.08 ± 0.02 m/yr.\\n\\nThe average short-term shoreline change rate for East Kauai is -0.06 ± 0.02 m/yr. Sixty-three percent of the short-term rates are erosional, the highest percentage for the four Kauai regions. East Kauai has the lowest percentage of accretional rates in the short term (33 percent) among the four Kauai regions. The maximum short-term erosion rate (-1.6 ± 0.3 m/yr) was measured in Anahola, north of Kuaehu Point, adjacent to a stone revetment. The maximum short-term accretion rate (1.1 ± 0.6 m/yr) was measured at the same location as the maximum long-term accretion rate (south of Anahola River).\\n\\nAlong the coast, long-term and short-term rates followed similar trends to each other. The long- and short-term confidence bands for Lae Lipoa are relatively wide because rates were calculated from only three to four shorelines.\\n\\nKauai\\'s southern coast is exposed to Kona storm waves, trade wind waves, and southern swell. Longshore currents transport sediment westward from the mouths of large rivers. Hurricane Iwa (1982) and Hurricane Iniki (1992) devastated this area, which was inundated as far as 300 m inland at Poipu.\\n\\nThe Waimea subregion lacks a shallow near-shore reef and has a wide, steep beach with a high proportion of rocky shoreline.\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\n|Transect number|Accretion|Erosion|Accretion|Erosion|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|100|Lihue Subregion| | | |\\n|200| | |Pacific|Ocean|\\n|300|Kapaa Subregion| | | |\\n|400| |2| |2|\\n| |3| |3| |\\n|500|East Kauai| | | |\\n| | | | |1 Nukolii|\\n| | | | |2 Waipouli|\\n| | | | |3 Kapaa|\\n| | | | |4 Lae Lipoa|\\n| | | | |5 Anahola|\\n| | | | |6 Kuaehu Point|\\n|700|Anahola Subregion| | | |\\n| |5| |5| |\\n| |6| |6| |\\n|800| |7| |7|\\n| |Long-term rates, in meters per year|Short-term rates, in meters per year| | |\\n| |EXPLANATION| | | |\\n| |95-percent confidence interval|Rate|Beach| |\\n\\nFigure 17.

(Location shown in figure 15)\\n---\\n## Historical Shoreline Change Analysis\\n\\nof terrigenous sediment (relative to typical calcareous long-term accretion rate (1.4 ± 0.7 m/yr) was measured at Waimea, east of Kikiaola Harbor (table 6, fig. 19). The beach on the western side of the harbor (Oomano) showed the highest erosion rate in the West Kauai region (see West Kauai, fig. 21). The harbor, built in 1959, disrupts alongshore transport of sand and acts as a groin, impounding sand on the Waimea (eastern) side and preventing sand from nourishing the beach at Oomano.\\n\\nThe west end of the Hanapepe subregion is composed of narrow, gently sloping, calcareous beach. The remainder of the Hanapepe and the Poipu subregions is composed of rejuvenated volcanic basalt with calcareous pocket beaches and fringing reef. The Mahaulepu subregion contains lithified sand dunes (fig. 18) (Makai Ocean Engineering and Sea Engineering, 1991; Fierstein and Fletcher, 2004).\\n\\nSummary statistics for South Kauai conflict in that average long- and short-term rates indicate approximately stable to accreting shorelines, whereas percentages of erosional and accretional transects indicate a predominance of erosion. The South region is made up of four subregions (fig. 19). From three to eight shorelines, ranging in date from 1926 to 2007, are available for the South region of Kauai (table 4). For the 790 transects, 28 percent of the short-term rates and 32 percent of the long-term rates are significant (fig. 19).\\n\\nUnlike the long-term average shoreline change rate, the short-term rate of 0.05 ± 0.04 m/yr suggests an overall trend of accretion along South Kauai (table 5). However, the beach is erosional at 57 percent of transects in the short term, suggesting an overall trend of erosion. The maximum short-term erosion rate (-1.7 ± 9.9 m/yr) was found at the end of a pocket beach in Lawai Bay (table 6, fig. 19), where an overall trend of erosion in the bay has resulted in loss of the beach at the eastern end of the bay prior to 1984. The high degree of uncertainty associated with this rate is a result of using truncated data (three shorelines) to calculate a rate in an area of beach loss. The maximum short-term accretion rate (1.7 ± 0.3 m/yr) was measured at the same position as the maximum long-term rate (Waimea—east of Kikiaola Small Boat Harbor). Long-term and short-term rates follow similar trends along the South Kauai coast (fig. 19), though, rates are less erosive in the short term as indicated by average rates and percentages of eroding and accreting transects (table 5).\\n\\nThe average long-term shoreline change rate for South Kauai is approximately stable at -0.01 ± 0.02 m/yr (table 5). Sixty-three percent of transects are erosional in the long term. The maximum long-term erosion rate (-1.5 ± 0.4 m/yr) was found at a small pocket beach north of Koki Point (table 6) where most of the remaining beach is now perched on a rock bench or has disappeared. Other locations with significant long-term erosion rates include Salt Pond (up to -0.8 ± 0.5 m/yr), Poipu (up to -0.3 ± 0.1), Shipwreck (up to -0.7 ± 0.4 m/yr), and Mahaulepu (up to -0.5 ± 0.4).\\n\\nFigure 18.

(Location shown in figure 15)\\n---\\n## Historical Shoreline Change Analysis\\n\\nWest Kauai\\n\\nKauai’s western coast is located on the Mana coastal plain, and is characterized by gently sloping beaches. The Mana Plain extends 5 km inland and is the product of converging longshore sediment transport from the north and southeast. The sediment transport from the north is driven by North Pacific swell and trade winds in winter; the transport from the southeast is driven by summer southern swell and trade winds (Moberly, 1968). The shoreline is composed of calcareous sand with outcrops of beach rock. Most of the beaches in this area are wide and backed by an extensive sand dune system.\\n\\nAs a whole, West Kauai is erosional in the long term and accretional in the short term. The West region is divided into three subregions. Shoreline change analysis for West Kauai was based on from three to nine shorelines ranging from 1926 to 2006. Only 12 and 13 percent of transects indicate significant rates in the long term and short term, respectively. Rates are significant for only a few isolated transects outside the Oomano subregion. West Kauai is exposed to refracted swells from the north in winter and from the south in summer. The seasonal shift in predominant wave direction results in high seasonal variability in shoreline position (noise), which is likely responsible for the low percentage of significant rates along West Kauai.\\n\\nThe average long-term rate in this region is erosional at -0.13 ± 0.04 m/yr, and 64 percent of transects are erosional in the long term. Average long-term rates in all subregions are erosional. The Oomano subregion is the most erosional, with an average rate of -0.64 ± 0.03 m/yr. The maximum long-term erosion rate (-1.4 ± 0.2 m/yr) was measured at Oomano, just west of Kikiaola Small Boat Harbor. As discussed in the section on the South Kauai region, the harbor blocks sediment transport from Waimea to the east that otherwise would nourish Oomano Beach. The maximum accretion rate (1.6 ± 1.8 m/yr) was found in Majors Bay at the shorefront of the Pacific Missile Range. This segment of beach experiences large seasonal fluctuations in shoreline position, resulting in high rate uncertainty.\\n\\nIn contrast to long-term shoreline change analysis, short-term analysis at West Kauai indicates an overall trend of accretion. The average of all short-term rates is accretional at 0.16 ± 0.08 m/yr. Roughly the same percentage of transects is accretional (49 percent) as erosional (48 percent). The maximum short-term erosion rate (-1.5 ± 0.3 m/yr) was measured at the same transect as the maximum long-term.\\n\\nFigure 20. Dunes at the west end of the Mana coastal plain, West Kauai.

The maximum few rates at individual transects along West Kauai are significantly due to high short-term (seasonal to decadal) variability in shoreline position.\\n\\nshort-term accretion rate (2.8 ± 6.2 m/yr) was measured at the northern end of Polihale (table 6), which is exposed to the full energy of large winter waves, resulting in seasonal fluctuations in shoreline position.\\n\\nThe alongshore pattern of variability of short-term shoreline change rates is similar to the pattern of long-term rates throughout most of West Kauai, with the exception of the north half of the Polihale subregion (fig. 21). However, the three subregions are significantly less erosional between the long term and short-term rates (table 7). The Polihale subregion is erosional in the long term with an average rate -0.14 ± 0.07 m/yr but accretional in the short term at 0.37 ± 0.11 m/yr. Similarly, Barking Sands is stable to erosional in the long term with an average rate -0.04 ± 0.06 m/yr but accretional in the short term at 0.18 ± 0.11 m/yr. Oomano is significantly erosional in the long and short-term shoreline change. Though, the average rate is somewhat reduced in the short term compared to the long term (-0.44 ± 0.02 m/yr compared to -0.64 ± 0.03 m/yr). Other than those at Oomano.\\n\\n## Oahu\\n\\nOahu is the third largest and most populated island of the Hawaiian chain. Oahu is made up of eroded remnants of two shield volcanoes (Waianae Range and Koolau Range, fig. 22) separated by the central Schofield Plateau (Macdonald and others, 1986). Explosive eruptions from the Honolulu Volcanic Series created several of the headlands on the southern-southeastern side of the island, including Diamond Head, Koko Head, and Mokapu Point. Emerged carbonate reefs formed under higher sea levels in the late Pleistocene Epoch compose many of the smaller headlands and underlie much of the coastal plain around the island. Oahu has approximately 107 km of sandy beach that is separated into four regions: north, east, south, and west.\\n\\n|North|Kahuku Point|\\n|---|---|\\n|West|Barbers Point|\\n|East|Makapuu Point|\\n|South| |\\n\\nFigure 22. Four regions of Oahu: north, east, south, and west.\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\nA maximum of 12 high-quality historical shorelines, ranging from 1910 to 2007, are available for Oahu (table 8). The earliest shoreline is derived from a 1910 or 1927 T-sheet or 1928 aerial photograph. A 1932–33 shoreline from a T-sheet is also included for some study areas. All other shorelines are derived from vertical aerial photographs taken from 1928 to 2007.\\n\\nErosion is the general long- and short-term trend of Oahu beaches. Approximately 9 km or 8 percent of the total length of beach analyzed was completely lost to erosion in the analysis period. The average of long-term rates for Oahu is erosional at -0.06 ± 0.01 m/yr. The average short-term rate is roughly the same as the long-term average rate at -0.05 ± 0.01 m/yr. Erosion is occurring in the long and short term at the majority of transects (60 and 58 percent, respectively). The maximum long- and short-term erosion rates on Oahu were found at Kualoa Point in East Oahu (-1.8 ± 0.3 and -1.9 ± 0.9 m/yr, respectively; table 9). The maximum long- and short-term accretion rates were found at Pokai Bay in West Oahu (1.7 ± 0.6 m/yr).\\n\\nThe long- and short-term rates at Pokai are equal because they were calculated using a truncated data set (1967–2007) following the construction of harbor breakwalls. The long-term rates at Kualoa and Pokai are the highest in the three islands.\\n\\n### Table 8.

This region is exposed to the strong winter North Pacific swell that causes steepening of the foreshore and narrowing of the beaches. During relatively calm summer conditions, the beaches are flat and wide (Hwang, 1981). A fringing reef of variable width and depth is present offshore. The coastal plain is variable in width and is composed largely of fossiliferous limestone and unconsolidated sand. Outcrops of calcareous eolianite and reefrock form many of the short headlands in this region, including those at Puaena Point, Sharks Cove, Kawela Bay, Kuilima (Turtle Bay), and Kahuku Point (fig. 23).\\n\\nThe North region is divided into two subregions: Sunset and Mokuleia (fig. 24). The Sunset subregion extends from Kahuku Point at the northern tip of the island to Haleiwa. A continuous 6-km-long beach extends from Waialee to Ke Iki. The remainder of the beaches in the Sunset subregion are in pockets between rocky headlands. The Mokuleia subregion is between Kaiaka Bay and Camp Erdman. Mokuleia Beach is a continuous 12-km-long beach extending from Waialua to Camp Erdman.\\n\\nTwenty-four percent of the short-term rates and 31 percent of the long-term rates at the 1,287 transects along North Oahu are significant—the lowest percentages in the four Oahu regions (fig. 24). The percentage of rates in this region that is significant is low as a result of high seasonal variability (noise) in shoreline position. Large winter swells cause variations in beach width by up to two thirds. The rates at some North Oahu beaches are also unreliable as a result of poor seasonal.\\n\\nEast Oahu\\n\\nOahu’s eastern coast faces into the predominant easterly trade winds. As a result, the shoreline is exposed to short-period trade wind waves year round. Large refracted North Pacific swells also affect this coast on occasion in winter. The coast is mostly a low-lying plain and is moderately to highly developed, with the densest development in the southeast, around Kailua and Lanikai (fig. 25).\\n\\nShallow fringing reef that lines much of East Oahu protects the shoreline from the full energy of large waves. However, beaches that back shallow protective reefs are typically low and narrow and are prone to inundation during large waves and storms. Even low rates of chronic erosion have led to beach loss along portions of these narrow beaches. Seawalls have been constructed along much of the coast to protect homes and the coastal highway, and contribute to beach loss in many areas. East Oahu is divided into two subregions, Northeast and Southeast, separated by Kaneohe Bay. The back-bay shoreline of Kaneohe Bay was not included in this study.\\n\\nFigure 23.

East Oahu beaches have from 5 to 12 shorelines with a date range from 1910 to 2006. Statistically significant shoreline change rates are found at 35 percent of the East Oahu transects in the long-term rates and 24 percent of the transects in the short-term rates.\\n\\nThe short-term rates follow trends similar to those of the long-term rates. Like the average long-term rate, the average short-term rate is approximately stable at -0.01 ± 0.01 m/yr. However, more transects are erosional in the short term than in the long-term rates, with erosion occurring at 54 percent of transects and accretion occurring at 44 percent.\\n\\nSouth Oahu\\'s southern shore is heavily developed on a predominantly low-lying coast, with much of the shoreline lined with hardened structures such as seawalls, revetments, and groins. This shore is exposed to strong trade winds that tend to blow alongshore, and southerly waves from the South Pacific and occasional Kona storms. Tsunamis and hurricanes pose a potential threat to the low-lying coastal plain and dense urban development. With the exception of Diamond Head and Koko Head, the coast is gently sloping with a wide, shallow fringing reef.\\n---\\n|Accretion|Erosion|Accretion|Erosion|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|1 East Oahu|N|1 Kahuku| |\\n|2 Laie| |3 Laniloa| |\\n|4 Hauula| |5 Makalii Point|2|\\n|6 Kahana|3|7 Kaaawa| |\\n|8 Kualoa|4|9 Mokapu| |\\n|10 Kailua| |11 Lanikai| |\\n|12 Bellows|5| |6|\\n|Kaneohe Bay| | | |\\n\\nTransect number\\n\\n|1,000|8|\\n|---|---|\\n|1,200|9|\\n|1,400|1246|\\n|1,600|10|\\n|1,800|11|\\n|2,000|12|\\n\\nLong-term rates, in meters per year\\n\\nShort-term rates, in meters per year\\n\\nEXPLANATION\\n\\n95-percent confidence interval\\n\\nRate\\n\\nBeach\\n\\nFigure 26.

As a result of extensive shoreline reconstruction, only historical shorelines for the modern configuration of artificially altered beaches were used to calculate change rates.\\n\\nThe average long-term shoreline change rate in the south (-0.04 ± 0.01 m/yr) and the percentage of eroding transects (50 percent) and accreting transects (48 percent) indicate a slight overall prevalence of erosion (table 5). The Ewa subregion is the most erosional section of South Oahu, with an average long-term rate of -0.06 ± 0.01 m/yr (table 10). The Honolulu subregion is also eroding in the long term (-0.05 ± 0.02 m/yr). The average long-term rate for the Maunalua subregion is slightly erosional to stable (-0.02 ± 0.02 m/yr).\\n\\nThe maximum long-term erosion rate (-1.6 ± 2.7 m/yr) was found at Queens Beach, Waikiki where the shoreline is hardened and much of the beach disappeared prior to 1975. Erosion up to -1.6 ± 0.4 m/yr is also occurring at the eastern end of the Ewa subregion near the Pearl Harbor entrance channel (Keahi Point), where erosion of a sandy headland has forced the removal of several homes and prompted construction of a boulder revetment. Other areas with significant long-term erosion rates include Nimitz Beach (up to -0.3 ± 0.1 m/yr), Oneula (up to -0.3 ± 0.2 m/yr), Sand Island (up to -0.3 ± 0.2 m/yr), Ala Moana (up to -0.8 ± 0.3 m/yr), Fort DeRussy (up to -0.8 ± 0.4 m/yr), and Kahala (-0.8 ± 0.7 m/yr, beach lost). The maximum long-term accretion rate (0.8 ± 0.2 m/yr) was found at Kaimana Beach in Waikiki, on the eastern side of the natatorium. The natatorium walls act as a groin, disrupting the westerly longshore transport of sediment and resulting in accretion on the eastern side of the natatorium (Kaimana) and erosion on the western side (Queens).\\n\\nFigure 27. The south end of Kahuku Beach, northeast Oahu, 1949, showing evidence of sand mining. The dunes were flattened, plowed into the surf, and shoveled to the loading machine. The beach width decreased approximately 60 meters from 1949 to 1967. (Location shown in figure 26)\\n\\nWaikiki is the hub of Hawaii’s tourist economy and the health of its beaches is critical to the state economy (Miller and Fletcher, 2003) (fig. 28). Waikiki was originally a wetland with a narrow strip of sandy beach. Development in this region started in the late 1800s, and the construction of a canal was proposed to divert streams from Waikiki, facilitating additional development. As development increased in the early 20th century, beach erosion became an increasing problem. Seawalls and groins were constructed and beach nourishment projects were pursued to maintain a healthy beach. Beach nourishment has continued into the 21st century, with the most recent nourishment project occurring in early 2012 (24,000 square yards). There are four subregions along South Oahu: Ewa, Honolulu, Maunalua, and Kaiwi.\\n\\nFrom 3 to 10 shorelines from 1927 to 2005 are available for analysis of South Oahu beaches (table 8). At the 1,319 transects, 36 percent of long-term rates and 34 percent of short-term rates are significant (fig. 29). The modern shoreline from Sand Island to Diamond Head (Honolulu subregion) bears little resemblance to the shoreline in its natural condition and is largely the result of engineering efforts (for example, groins, sand fill, and seawalls) intended to widen the beach.\\n\\nFigure 28.

(Location shown in figure 22)\\n---\\n## Historical Shoreline Change Analysis\\n\\nThe average short-term rate of -0.03 ± 0.02 m/yr is similar to the average long-term rate. For the long-term rates, as for the short-term rates, the percentages of eroding and accreting transects are approximately equal (table 5). The maximum short-term erosion and accretion rates were measured at the same locations as the maximum long-term erosion and accretion rates, respectively (Kaimana and Queens, Waikiki).\\n\\nThe long-term and short-term rates follow similar trends (fig. 29) along the shore and average rates and percentages of eroding and accreting transects are similar in the long- and short-term shoreline changes. Similarities between long- and short-term trends along South Oahu may be a result of extensive use of truncated data sets for rate calculation in areas with engineered shoreline (only recent shorelines used for long- and short-term analysis) and limited availability of pre-WWII shorelines for many areas (for example, only one shoreline removed from the data set for short-term rate calculation).\\n\\n### West Oahu\\n\\nOahu’s leeward western coast consists of sandy beach embayments and basaltic and limestone headlands. The shore is exposed to refracted North Pacific swells in winter and southerly swells in summer. Easterly trade winds blow offshore along most of this coastline. Southerly Kona storm winds blow onshore and can cause temporary beach erosion. Shoreline position is highly variable at many beaches in this region, as sand shifts alongshore with alternating wave direction between the North Pacific and southern swell seasons. There is a moderate risk of coastal flooding from large winter waves and when tropical storms pass near this region (Fletcher and others, 2002).\\n\\nMost of the coast is gently sloping. The coast becomes more rocky and narrow near Kaena Point (northwestern point of Oahu). The shoreline is composed of carbonate sand and limestone rock, and beach rock is prevalent (Fletcher, 2010). The West region is made up of three subregions: Makua, Waianae, and Nanakuli. The three subregions in West Oahu have from 6 to 12 shorelines, with a date range from 1910 to 2007 (table 8). Forty-six and 26 percent of the rates at the 628 transects are significant in the long- and short-term, respectively (fig. 30).\\n\\nWest Oahu is the most erosional region of the island, with an average long-term rate of -0.25 ± 0.01 m/yr and 83 percent of transects indicating erosion in the long term (table 5). All three subregions are erosional in the long term, with average rates of at least -0.20 m/yr (table 10). The maximum long-term erosion rate (-1.2 ± 0.5 m/yr) was found in the northern part of Maili Beach (table 9, fig. 31) and is at least partly the result of removal of sand by mining operations in the mid-1900s (Hwang, 1981; Sea Engineering, Inc., 1988). Sand mining was widespread along western Oahu beaches and also likely affects.\\n\\n### Maui\\n\\nMaui is the third largest of the Hawaiian Islands. It is composed of two shield volcanoes, West Maui and Haleakala, with a low-lying isthmus separating them. The approximately 90 km of sandy beach on Maui is separated into three subregions for analysis: North Maui, Kihei, and West Maui (fig. 32). From 3 to 10 high-quality historical shorelines with dates ranging from 1899 to 2007 are available for Maui (table 11). The shoreline from the earliest time period was derived from a T-sheet; all other shorelines were derived from vertical aerial photographs.\\n\\nMaui’s beaches are the most erosional among the three islands (table 5). Average shoreline change rates for all analysis regions and subregions are erosional (tables 5 and 12). The average long-term rate for all transects is -0.17 ± 0.01 m/yr and the average short-term rate is -0.15 ± 0.01 m/yr. A majority of the Maui transects indicate erosion with 85 percent of the long-term rates erosional and 76 percent of the short-term rates erosional. Eleven percent (6.8 km) of the total extent of Maui beaches studied was lost to erosion during the analysis period—the highest percentage of the three islands.\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\n|Accretion|Erosion|Accretion|Erosion|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|0| |N|1|\\n|Makua Subregion| |1| |\\n| | |2| |\\n|100| |3|West Oahu|\\n| | |1 Yokohama| |\\n| | |2 Makua| |\\n|200| |3 Keaau| |\\n| | |4 M.

The coastal plain in the north, along Maalaea Bay, is a flat, sand-rich terrace with barrier beaches, dunes, and wetlands that have been greatly affected by development. The coastal plain becomes progressively narrower to the south with basalt headlands marking boundaries between watersheds lacking dissected valleys. The fringing reef along the Kihei coast is generally narrower and deeper than along North and West Maui. The beaches in the northern and southern sections of Kihei are generally wider than those in the central portion.\\n---\\n|Transect number|Central Kihei Subregion|\\n|---|---|\\n|0|Accretion|\\n|100|Erosion|\\n|200|Accretion|\\n|300|Erosion|\\n|400|Accretion|\\n|500|Erosion|\\n|600|Accretion|\\n|700|Erosion|\\n|800|Accretion|\\n|900|Erosion|\\n|1000|Accretion|\\n\\nLong-term rates, in meters per year\\n\\nShort-term rates, in meters per year\\n\\nEXPLANATION\\n\\n95-percent confidence interval\\n\\nRate\\n\\nBeach\\n\\nFigure 35.

Short, University of Sydney)\\n---\\n## Historical Shoreline Change Analysis\\n\\nKihei is highly erosional compared to study regions of Kauai and Oahu, based on average rates and percentages of transects indicating erosion (table 5). However, rates along Kihei are lower than along the highly erosional beaches of North Maui. Of the 1,011 transects in Kihei, statistically significant change rates were found at 22 percent of transects in the long term and 19 percent of transects in the short term—the lowest percentages in the three Maui regions (fig. 35). The low proportion of significant rates at Kihei relative to the other Maui regions may be a result of high short-term variability in shoreline position (noise), as the number and range of dates of historical shorelines available (3 to 9 shorelines, 1900 to 2007) are similar to those in other Maui regions (table 11). Two km, or 11 percent, of the total length of Kihei beaches analyzed in this study was completely lost to erosion. The average long-term rate of shoreline change at Kihei is -0.13 ± 0.01 m/yr. Eighty-three percent of transects are erosional in the long term and 77 percent are erosional in the short term. The maximum long-term erosion rate (-1.1 ± 0.6 m/yr) was found at Kawililipoa, in the remains of a fish pond (table 13). Other areas with substantial long-term erosion include South Wailea (up to -0.5 ± 0.2 m/yr), North Wailea (up to -0.4 ± 0.2 m/yr), Kalama Park (up to -0.8 ± 0.5 m/yr; beach lost), and Maalaea (up to -0.6 ± 0.2 m/yr). The maximum long-term accretion rate (1.6 ± 0.4 m/yr) was also found at Kawililipoa, along an accretional cusp.\\n\\nThe average short-term rate is -0.12 ± 0.02 m/yr, and 77 percent of the short-term rates are erosional (table 5). The maximum short-term erosion rate (-1.8 ± 7.5 m/yr) was found at Kalepolepo Beach Park, where the beach has been completely lost to erosion. The maximum short-term accretion rate was found at the same location as the maximum long-term accretion rate (Kawililipoa; 1.8 ± 0.8 m/yr). Long- and short-term rates have similar overall trends.\\n\\n## West Maui\\n\\nWest Maui (fig. 38) has a gently arcing convex coast. From south to north, the shoreline changes orientation from southwest-, to west-, to northwest-facing. The shoreline is generally characterized by lengths of sandy beach interrupted by rocky headlands and engineered structures (fig. 39). The islands of Molokai, Lanai, and Kahoolawe offer partial protection from swells. The region is affected by alternating summer southern swell and the winter North Pacific swell that causes substantial changes in the beach profile and shifts in sediment along the coast. This region is heavily dissected by watersheds that produce large alluvial fans during low sea-level stands. Shallow fringing reefs line much of this coast, especially in the central and southern portions. Most beaches are narrow and often sand depleted. West Maui is divided into three subregions for further analysis: Lahaina, Kaanapali, and Napili–Kapalua.\\n\\nWest Maui has from 5 to 10 historical shorelines, with dates ranging from 1912 to 1997 (table 11). Of the 1,519 transects, 27 percent of long-term rates and 18 percent of short-term rates are significant (fig. 38). Roughly 4 km, or 14 percent, of the total length of beach analyzed was completely lost to erosion during the study period—the highest percentage of beach loss of any region on the three islands (tied with South Kauai, table 5).\\n\\nThe average of all long-term rates for West Maui is -0.15 ± 0.01 m/yr and 85 percent of transects are erosional in the long term. All subregions in West Maui are erosional in the long and short term based on average rates. The Napili-Kapalua subregion has the highest average erosion rates, -0.22 ± 0.02 m/yr in the long term and -0.19 ± 0.03 m/yr in the short term (table 12). The maximum erosion rate (-0.9 ± 0.6 m/yr) was found at Ukumehame adjacent to a boulder revetment installed to protect the coastal highway (table 13).\\n\\nOther areas of significant long-term erosion include Hekili Point (up to -0.3 ± 0.2 m/yr), Olowalu (up to -0.3 ± 0.2 m/yr), Launiupoko (up to -0.5 ± 0.3 m/yr), Puamana (up to -0.5 ± 0.2 m/yr), Mala Wharf (up to -0.5 ± 0.4 m/yr), Honokowai (up to -0.5 ± 0.4 m/yr), Kahana (up to -0.4 ± 0.1 m/yr), and Napili Bay (up to -0.4 ± 0.2 m/yr). The maximum long-term accretion rate (0.6 ± 0.2 m/yr) was measured at Puunoa Point. The accretional cell at Puunoa Point is flanked by erosion at the Lahaina and Mala Wharf shorefronts, suggesting that eroded sediment is transported from the adjacent beaches and deposited at Puunoa Point.\\n\\nErosion at West Maui is slightly lower in the short-term than in the long-term rate, with an average short-term rate of -0.13 ± 0.01 m/yr, and 77 percent of transects are erosional in the long term. The maximum short-term erosion rate (-0.7 ± 1.7 m/yr) was found at Mokuleia Beach (table 13). The percentage of accretion increased from 14 (for long-term rates) to 18 (for short-term rates). The maximum short-term accretion rate was found at the same location as the maximum rate in the long-term analysis (Puunoa Point at Lahaina).\\n---\\n|Transect number|Accretion|Erosion|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|1| | |\\n|2| | |\\n|3| | |\\n|4| | |\\n|5| | |\\n|6| | |\\n|7| | |\\n|8| | |\\n|9| | |\\n|10| | |\\n|11| | |\\n|12| | |\\n|13| | |\\n|14| | |\\n\\n|Long-term rates, in meters per year|Short-term rates, in meters per year|\\n|---|---|\\n|-0.5|-0.5|\\n|0|0|\\n|0.5|0.5|\\n\\nEXPLANATION\\n\\nFigure 38.

(Location shown in figure 32)\\n---\\n## Discussion and Additional Considerations\\n\\nSummary of Shoreline Changes\\n\\nShoreline change along Kauai, Oahu, and Maui beaches is dominated by erosion. However, shoreline change is highly variable along Hawaii beaches with cells of erosion and accretion typically separated by only a few hundred meters on continuous beaches or by short headlands that divide the coast into many small embayments. Twenty-two km or 9 percent of the total length of beach analyzed was completely lost to erosion during the analysis period.\\n\\nOahu lost the greatest total length of beach to erosion (8.7 km), whereas Maui had the highest percentage of beach loss (11 percent). The average of long-term rates from all transects on the three islands is -0.11 ± 0.01 m/yr and the majority, or 70 percent, of the transects indicate a trend of erosion in the long term. Erosion is also the short-term trend for the three islands, with an average rate of -0.06 ± 0.01 m/yr and 63 percent of transects indicating beach erosion.\\n\\nThe maximum long-term erosion rate (-1.8 ± 0.3 m/yr) was measured at Kualoa Point, Oahu. The maximum short-term erosion rate (-2.2 ± 1.1 m/yr) was measured at Baldwin Park, Maui. The maximum long-term accretion rate (1.7 ± 0.6 m/yr) was measured at Pokai Bay, Oahu. The maximum short-term accretion rate (2.8 ± 6.2 m/yr) was measured at the northern end of Polihale Beach, Kauai, although this rate is associated with a high degree of uncertainty caused by seasonal variability.\\n\\nMaui beaches are clearly the most erosional of the three islands with average long- and short-term erosion rates of -0.17 ± 0.01 and -0.15 ± 0.01 m/yr, respectively. Eighty-five percent of Maui transects indicate a trend of erosion in the long term and 76 percent indicate erosion in the short-term rates. Long-term trends for Kauai beaches are intermediate with an average rate -0.11 ± 0.01 m/yr and 71 percent of transects indicating a trend of erosion. Kauai is the only island whose average short-term change rate is not erosional (0.02 ± 0.02 m/yr) due largely to increased beach accretion along West Kauai in the short term. However, the majority (57 percent) of transects on Kauai beaches indicate a trend of erosion. Oahu has the lowest average long-term erosion rate of the three islands at -0.06 ± 0.01 m/yr. However, erosion is still the dominant trend of shoreline change on Oahu with 60 percent of transects indicating a trend of erosion in the long term. Short-term analysis for Oahu signifies a similar trend of erosion as the long-term analysis with an average rate of -0.05 ± 0.01 m/yr and 58 percent of transects indicating erosion.\\n---\\n## National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands\\n\\nInfluences of Human Activities\\n\\nCoastal property in many areas of Hawaii is at a premium, and the encroachment of the Pacific Ocean onto multimillion-dollar residential and commercial lands and development has not gone unnoticed by landowners. In many cases, the response is to armor the shoreline with seawalls, revetments, sand bags, and other structures and devices. Artificial hardening of the shoreline protects coastal land at the expense of the beach where chronic erosion occurs as waves are prevented from accessing the sand reservoirs impounded behind hard structures. Sandy shoreline adjacent to armoring experiences flanking erosion, extending the erosion problem along the shoreline and subjecting adjacent properties to the challenges of managing erosion. Therefore, efforts to mitigate coastal erosion have created a serious problem of beach loss and flanking erosion resulting from sand deficiency and wave reflection from hard structures along many shorelines in the state, particularly on the most populated and developed islands. The State of Hawaii and local communities acknowledge the need to address this issue, and hope that a broadly scoped management plan will balance the natural morphology of the coast with human-resource needs (Hwang, 2005).\\n\\nPlanned Updates and Related Research\\n\\nThe USGS plans to revise and update rates of shoreline change every 5 to 10 years. Therefore, this report and associated data are a work in progress. The revision interval will depend on the availability of new shoreline data and technological advances. Continued monitoring of shoreline change is vital in the coming decades as the dynamics of the coastal environment that lead to beach erosion (for example, sea-level rise, storms, and waves) are likely to change with changing climate.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe authors thank Michael Rink and David Doyle of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Castle Foundation for funding erosion studies on Kauai and Oahu.\\n\\nRates of Shoreline Change and Stabilization Practices\\n\\nRates of shoreline change can be influenced by shore-stabilization practices. Artificial beach replenishment and engineering structures tend to alter coastal processes, sediment availability, and shoreline position. For example, beach nourishment artificially causes rapid, temporary shoreline accretion. Depending on the frequency of beach nourishment, the placement of large volumes of sand on the beach may bias the rates of observed shoreline change toward accretion or stability, even though the natural beach, in the absence of nourishment, would be eroding.\\n\\nIn Hawaii, nourishment has not played a major role in the management of beach resources around the state other than at Waikiki. The most common stabilization approach has been shoreline hardening in the form of seawalls.

Land elevation is the primary geophysical variable that determines exposure to inundation in coastal settings. Accordingly, coastal elevation data (with accuracy information) are critical for assessments of inundation exposure. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of using high-accuracy elevation data and rigorously accounting for uncertainty in inundation assessments. A quantitative analysis of inundation exposure was conducted for Majuro Atoll, including accounting for the cumulative vertical uncertainty from the input digital elevation model (DEM) and datum transformation. The project employed a recently produced and validated DEM derived from structure-from-motion processing of very-high-resolution aerial imagery. Areas subject to marine inundation (direct hydrologic connection to the ocean) and low-lying lands (disconnected hydrologically from the ocean) were mapped and characterized for three inundation levels using deterministic and probabilistic methods. At the highest water level modeled (3.75 ft, or 1.143 m), more than 34% of the atoll study area is likely to be exposed to inundation (68% chance or greater), while more than 20% of the atoll is extremely likely to be exposed (95% chance or greater). The study demonstrates the substantial value of a high-accuracy DEM for assessing inundation exposure of low-relief islands and the enhanced information from accounting for vertical uncertainty.\\n\\nKeywords: inundation; flooding; sea-level rise; digital elevation model; vertical accuracy; uncertainty; confidence level; error propagation; coastal vulnerability\\n\\n### 1. Introduction\\n\\nLow-lying islands are vulnerable to inundation (coastal flooding), whether the increased water levels are from episodic events (storm surge, wave run-up, king tides) or from chronic conditions (long-term sea-level rise). Atolls are particularly vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise in the form of Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 154; doi:10.3390/rs12010154 www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\\n---\\n## Remote Sens. 2019, 11, x\\n\\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 154\\n\\n(long-term sea-level rise). Atolls are particularly vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise in the form of shoreline erosion, inundation, and saltwater intrusion into fresh groundwater [1]. Numerous studies have assessed climate change-driven impacts and other environmental factors on the shoreline erosion, inundation, and saltwater intrusion into fresh groundwater [1]. Numerous studies resilience of low-lying islands, including biophysical changes [2–8] and biodiversity consequences have assessed climate change-driven impacts and other environmental factors on the resilience of [9,10]. low-lying islands, including biophysical changes [2–8] and biodiversity consequences [9,10]. Coastal vulnerability is inherently spatial, and this geographic dependence requires that risk assessments of places, people, and assets be location specific [11]. For such assessments, mapping and characterization of physical hazards are critical, and the need is great for detailed, localized analyses rather than more general coarse-scale assessments [6]. In particular, detailed knowledge of the topography is essential for assessing coastal inundation exposure, especially on low-lying lands, and the lack of suitable elevation data has been noted [1,12–14]. Majuro Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands, in the central Pacific bears all the marks of high coastal vulnerability, including low-lying islands [13], rising sea level (far greater than the global average) [15,16], high wave events [17,18], eroding shorelines [3], a dense population center in an expanding urban area [3], and limited freshwater resources [19]. Existing general assessments [2,9,10] lack the spatially explicit detail that is needed for informing local adaptation planning, in part due to the coarse nature of the topographic information used. New remote sensing-derived high-resolution, high-accuracy elevation data for Majuro Atoll, including comprehensive uncertainty information [13], represent a valuable resource for coastal hazard assessment. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of using high-accuracy elevation data and rigorously accounting for uncertainty in coastal flooding assessments [20–26]. The focus of this paper is a quantitative inundation exposure assessment complete with best practices for considering vertical uncertainty, that demonstrates the advantages of using a remote sensing-derived high-resolution, high-accuracy elevation model to produce spatially explicit hazard information. The results are a first for Majuro Atoll and are useful for climate change adaptation planning and mitigation.\\n\\n## Materials and Methods\\n\\n### Study Area\\n\\nMajuro Atoll (Figure 1), located in the central Pacific Ocean approximately 3800 km southwest of Hawaii, is a roughly oval-shaped string of over 60 low-relief islands that encircle a lagoon of about 300 km2. It is in the Ratak (eastern) Chain of the Marshall Islands and is centered at 7°07′N latitude and 171°12′E longitude. Majuro, the capital city of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), is located at the eastern end of the atoll. The total land area of the atoll is about 10 km2. The portion of the atoll used in this study is the entire connected southern half that runs from Laura in the west to Rita in the northeast—a length of about 48 km.\\n\\nFigure 1. Majuro Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands.\\n---\\n## Digital Elevation Models\\n\\nThe high-resolution, high-accuracy digital elevation model (DEM) used in this assessment is derived from unmanned aircraft system (UAS) imagery processed with structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques [13]. The 1-m spatial resolution DEM represents bare ground conditions, as vegetation and buildings have been removed (seawalls and other shoreline protection structures were not removed). The dense three-dimensional (3D) point cloud was automatically classified in Agisoft PhotoScan into two classes, ground points (bare earth) and unclassified (vegetation, buildings, water, and noise) points. This classification was further manually and iteratively refined to derive a bare-earth DEM. Each iteration consisted in manually comparing the previous bare-earth DEM with the 3D red, green, blue (RGB) colored point cloud and area SfM orthomosaic to identify and fix points misclassified by the automatic classifier.\\n\\nNumerous global or near-global DEMs are available and they have been used extensively for sea-level rise and coastal flooding assessments [25]. These DEMs have been assessed for Majuro Atoll to help demonstrate the advantages of the high-accuracy elevation data for inundation modeling. The following DEMs, summarized in Table 1, are included: Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) [27], ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) [28], ALOS World 3D (AW3D30) [29], and TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X) [30]. In addition to these freely available global DEMs, a commercial DEM product derived from WorldView high-resolution satellite stereo-optical imagery, the DigitalGlobe Advanced Elevation Series (DG-AES) [31], was also included in the analysis.\\n\\n|DEM|Grid Spacing|Accuracy Specification (RMSE 1 in m)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|UAS-SfM 2|1 m|0.30|\\n|SRTM 3|1-arc-s (30 m)|9.73|\\n|ASTER GDEM 4|1-arc-s (30 m)|10.20|\\n|AW3D30 5|1-arc-s (30 m)|5.0|\\n|TanDEM-X 6|0.4-arc-s (12 m)|6.08|\\n|DG-AES 7|2 m|2.43|\\n\\n1 RMSE: root mean square error. 2 UAS-SfM: Unmanned aircraft system—Structure-from-motion. 3 SRTM: Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. 4 ASTER GDEM: ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model. 5 AW3D30: ALOS World 3D. 6 TanDEM-X: TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement. 7 DG-AES: DigitalGlobe—Advanced Elevation Series.\\n\\n## Accuracy Assessment\\n\\nTo characterize vertical uncertainty, the absolute vertical accuracy of each of the DEMs was measured by comparison with a very large set of independent reference points. The nearly 69,000 high-accuracy geodetic control points from a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) real-time kinematic (RTK) survey have a vertical root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03 m [13], and so they are an excellent reference dataset with which to validate the DEMs. To gather the required error statistics that describe vertical accuracy, the independent reference points are compared to the DEMs at each point location. In each case, the DEM elevation is extracted via bilinear interpolation at the exact point location and the difference in reference elevation and DEM elevation is recorded, with the difference representing the vertical error. The differencing operation is done by subtracting the reference point elevation from the DEM elevation. In this way, the difference statistics from the full set of points are easy to interpret; that is, a positive mean error indicates that on average the DEM is too high (the DEM has a positive bias). Conversely, a negative mean error indicates that on average the DEM is too low (it has a negative bias).\\n\\nBefore comparing the DEM and the reference data, both datasets must be in the same vertical reference frame, so that the difference statistics do not contain any artificial biases. The DEMs and reference point data include a mix of different vertical reference systems: SRTM, ASTER GDEM, and AW3D30 are referenced to the Earth Gravitational Model 1996 (EGM96) geoid; TanDEM-X is referenced\\n---\\n## Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 154\\n\\n4 of 20 to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84)-G1150 ellipsoid; and the UAS-SfM DEM and check points are referenced to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame 2008 (ITRF2008) ellipsoid. The check points and each DEM were brought into the same vertical reference frame with a standard procedure employed in DEM assessments [32].\\n\\n## 2.3. Tidal Datums\\n\\nThe high-resolution, high-accuracy UAS-SfM DEM was originally produced in ellipsoid referenced vertical coordinates (due to the geodetic control point information acquired via GNSS survey that was used to georeference the UAS imagery), but was transformed to orthometric (mean sea level referenced) elevations with a local geoid model developed from leveled benchmarks located throughout the atoll [13]. Long-term water level data were processed to derive tidal datums so that inundation modeling could be done in a sea-level reference frame. Hourly water level data from the Majuro tide gauge (located on the lagoon shoreline at the east end of the atoll) for the period May 1993 through July 2017 were downloaded from the Pacific Sea Level and Geodetic Monitoring Project (Australian Bureau of Meteorology) [33], which includes 12 gauges in the Pacific that are part of the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) network [34]. The hourly data were processed to derive the vertical offsets from local mean sea level (LMSL) for mean lower low water (MLLW) and mean higher high water (MHHW). Based on the processed tide gauge record, MLLW is 0.616 m below LMSL and MHHW is 0.645 m above LMSL, resulting in a mean tidal range of 1.261 m.\\n\\n## 2.4. Inundation Assessment Parameters\\n\\nWhen conducting an inundation exposure assessment, a critical parameter is the increment of water level increase that is modeled. Previous research has established that the chosen water level increment must be supported by the inherent accuracy of the underlying elevation data [23–25,35]. In other words, relative to the DEM uncertainty (vertical error), the increment must not be so small that it is “within the noise”; thus, a highly accurate DEM is required to model fine increments of water level increase with high confidence results. Using published methods [25], the minimum allowable increments of increased water level at specific confidence levels were calculated for the UAS-SfM DEM based on its measured vertical accuracy. Modeling inundation using a DEM is essentially an elevation contouring operation wherein the “contour” is delineated at the elevation of the increased water level. Consequently, the use of contour accuracy standards is an effective way to determine the increment of water level increase (or the contour interval) at a specified statistical confidence level given the vertical accuracy of the DEM [25].\\n\\n## 2.5. Inundation Mapping\\n\\nThe selected water levels were mapped with three approaches, including one that does not consider vertical uncertainty (elevation model error) and two others that account for vertical uncertainty in different ways. The inundation model is a simple hydrostatic [36] model (still water or flat water, so no effect of waves), which is often referred to as a bathtub model. Bathtub inundation has also been called single-value surface [35], equilibrium [37], planar [38], and static inundation [39]. In this study, inundation from a direct surface hydrologic connection to the ocean [40] is marine inundation, and the low elevations below the specified water level that are disconnected hydrologically from the ocean are designated as low-lying areas. In some cases, these areas have been referred to as areas with “groundwater inundation” [41,42], although the inundation may be due to not only raised groundwater levels but also king tides, run-up of high waves, runoff from precipitation, or some combination of these factors. The importance of mapping these low-lying areas has been recognized in numerous studies [8,22,43–49].\\n---\\n## Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 154\\n\\n2.5.1. Deterministic\\n\\nThe simplest, and most often employed, method of mapping projected inundation onto the land surface raises the water level on a coastal DEM by delineating all areas that fall below a specified elevation (at the height of the raised water level). This approach is called deterministic as the location and extent of the projected inundated area are determined simply by where the specified elevation of the raised water level falls on the land [25]. Exposure assessments that use the deterministic mapping approach have no indication of the quality of the mapping, nor is there any statement of confidence level of the results. The primary limitation of deterministic mapping is that the implications of vertical uncertainty (elevation error) are unrepresented and cannot be factored into the use of the assessment results. The user of such an assessment is provided with no information about the quality of the results. For this study, deterministic mapping is included to help demonstrate its limitations and the increased information in inundation exposure mapping methods that consider the inherent vertical uncertainty present in all elevation-based assessments.\\n\\n2.5.2. Modified Deterministic\\n\\nAn alternative, and improved, approach to simple deterministic mapping considers vertical uncertainty by applying a global error metric associated with the DEM, such as the widely used RMSE, or a related measure like “linear error at 95% confidence” (LE95) [50]. The modified deterministic approach [25] equally applies the full global error everywhere, thereby assuming that all areas are subject to the full range of vertical error and the results reflect a range incorporating the minimum and maximum extremes of error. The full vertical error is subtracted from and added to the elevation of the raised water level, and then those two elevations are used to delineate the minimum and maximum projected inundation zones. Each delineation is still a deterministic mapping approach, thus the name, modified deterministic. This modified approach has the advantage over the simple deterministic approach because it accounts for vertical uncertainty by bounding the projected area and assigning a confidence label based on the portion of the full error probability distribution represented by the error metric (for instance 68% confidence for RMSE or 95% confidence in the case of LE95). For assessments conducted with the modified deterministic method, the confidence level indicates how confident a user can be that the true extent of the projected inundation zone is contained within the stated range (between the minimum and maximum areas).\\n\\n2.5.3. Probabilistic\\n\\nThe third approach to inundation mapping includes the most complete treatment of vertical uncertainty. The probabilistic method [25] produces results that indicate the likelihood, or probability, of any location falling above or below a specified elevation (the height of the raised water level in an inundation exposure assessment). In implementing the method, the elevation error is modeled and then that error is propagated spatially through Monte Carlo simulation [51] using maps of the spatial distribution of probable errors. Random error fields that match the error distribution of the DEM (as derived from a vertical accuracy assessment) are generated and applied spatially. To account for spatial autocorrelation in the errors [52], spatial filtering using a low pass, or smoothing, filter is performed before the error model is applied to the DEM in each realization [52–54]. For this study, the Monte Carlo simulation included 750 realizations of probable cumulative vertical error to build the spatial map of inundation probability at the given water level scenarios. Note that the inundation probability in this case only considers elevation uncertainty and water level recurrence (or return interval) is not included. For this study, three discrete water levels were modeled (see Section 3.1), although the probability of future water levels has been incorporated into some previous inundation assessments [21]. There is a rich heritage of treating elevation error probabilistically [52,55–57], and the method has been successfully applied and its advantages demonstrated in numerous recent sea-level rise and\\n---\\n### Results\\n\\n### Cumulative Vertical Uncertainty and Corresponding Minimum Inundation Levels\\n\\nThe primary source of vertical uncertainty in an inundation exposure assessment is the DEM error. For this reason, using a high-accuracy DEM is desirable and allows fine increments of water level increases to be modeled, which is especially important for low-relief environments. Figure 2 shows the elevation error statistics for the UAS-SfM DEM of Majuro Atoll as determined in the absolute vertical accuracy assessment using the reference GNSS survey points. For purposes of inundation modeling, there is an additional source of vertical accuracy that should also be considered. As previously stated, the UAS-SfM DEM’s native vertical coordinates are ellipsoid referenced. However, it is important to include local water level information when mapping projected inundation [63] by delineating impact areas above the high tide line as areas below this line are already subject to periodic inundation from the normal action of tides. To do such delineation, the DEM must first be transformed to orthometric elevations from its native ellipsoid referenced elevations. The required transformation is done by applying the local geoid; however, the geoid model also has vertical uncertainty that must be considered. The vertical uncertainty of the local geoid model is estimated at 0.061 m (one sigma error) [64], which is the standard deviation of the differences between the predicted point values and the actual point values derived from cross validation of the results of empirical Bayesian kriging used to generate the geoid surface [13]. The geoid error of 0.061 m is combined with the DEM error of 0.179 m (RMSE) via a root sum of squares (or summing in quadrature) resulting in a cumulative vertical uncertainty of 0.189 m (7.44 inches [in.]) RMSE. When accounting for vertical uncertainty in inundation assessments, combining DEM error and datum transformation error into cumulative vertical uncertainty is a recognized best practice that has been successfully employed in numerous recent studies [22–24,46,65–68].\\n\\nThe minimum allowable increment of water level increase for specific confidence levels was calculated using established methods [25]. Given the cumulative vertical uncertainty of 0.189 m, a 15 in. (1.25 ft, or 0.381 m) increment can be mapped with 68% confidence, a 30 in. (2.5 ft, or 0.762 m) increment at 95% confidence, and a 45 in. (3.75 ft, or 1.143 m) increment at 99% confidence. Note that English units are used here, and following, as those units are most commonly used in the Marshall Islands. For context on these increments of water level increase, consider the following: an increase in water level of 25.4 in. (0.645 m) would be the equivalent of LMSL moving up to the current high tide line (MHHW). Under such a scenario, and assuming the tidal range stays the same, an additional 9% of currently “dry” land (land currently above MHHW) would be subject to regular inundation by normal tides.\\n\\nThe three selected water levels (1.25 ft, 2.5 ft, and 3.75 ft, or 0.381 m, 0.762 m, and 1.143 m, respectively) were mapped using the three approaches described above. For comparison purposes, Table 2 displays the results of the vertical accuracy assessments of the other DEMs available for Majuro Atoll, as well as the corresponding minimum inundation increments. Additional information on the uncertainty of the DEMs is presented in Figures S1–S3 in the Supplementary Materials. As reflected in the values in Table 2, less accurate DEMs, even though the measured accuracies are better than product specifications (Table 1), do not allow high confidence mapping of small water level increases, and thus have little or no value for spatially explicit inundation exposure assessment of low-relief coastal settings like Majuro Atoll.\\n---\\n## Validation of Vertical Uncertainty\\n\\nValidation of the results of empirical Bayesian kriging used to generate the geoid surface [13]. The geoid error of 0.061 m is combined with the DEM error of 0.179 m (RMSE) via a root sum of squares (or summing in quadrature) resulting in a cumulative vertical uncertainty of 0.189 m (7.44 inches [in.]) RMSE. When accounting for vertical uncertainty in inundation assessments, combining DEM error and datum transformation error into cumulative vertical uncertainty is a recognized best practice that has been successfully employed in numerous recent studies [22–24,46,65–68].\\n\\nMajuro DEM Absolute Vertical Accuracy: Land elevation GNSS Reference Points Kaxinutn Standurd Devialior 077 RMSE = 0.179 meters\\n\\nFigure 2.

The modified deterministic approach provides bounds for projected inundation with a corresponding confidence level that the true area falls somewhere within the stated range. However, the range can become large, especially at a higher water level (for instance see marine inundation of 3.75 ft, or 1.143 m, at 95% confidence), which may limit the usefulness of the estimate. For the results of the probabilistic approach, note how the estimated area generally tends to be much closer to the low end of the range of the corresponding modified deterministic results; for example, 9.46% for 2.5 ft (0.762 m) of marine inundation at 68% probability (Table 4) compared to the modified deterministic range of 7.43–21.62% at 68% confidence. With the probabilistic approach, any probability of inundation (between 0% and 100%) can be used; 68% and 95% are used here to match the confidence levels used in the modified deterministic approach. When comparing probabilistic results with corresponding deterministic results (same water level and same inundation type) (Tables 3 and 4), in all cases, the areas exposed to inundation are less for the probabilistic approach than the deterministic approach. Thus, in addition to results from deterministic mapping carrying no confidence level, the method consistently overpredicts the size of the area exposed to inundation.\\n\\nMaps of example inundation areas help illustrate some of the effects of various mapping methods and confidence/probability levels.

The input dataset for probabilistic inundation mapping, which is derived from spatial error propagation through Monte Carlo simulation. The probability of inundation at any location for a given water level increase is simply the count of the number of times the location was included in the inundation mask divided by the number of realizations (750 for this study). Figures 6 and 7 were derived from the continuous variable (inundation probability) grid by applying different probability thresholds (68% and 95% for Figures 6 and 7, respectively). (A–D) are the detailed areas (subsets of the full study area) of Majuro Atoll as indicated in Figure 3.\\n---\\n### Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 154\\n\\nFigures 4–6 show the progression of projected areas exposed to inundation as the water level increases through the three scenarios (when mapping method and probability are held constant). Note that not only do the exposed areas increase, as would be expected, but also low-lying areas are “converted” to marine inundation areas as water level increases. At higher water levels, a direct hydrologic connection to the ocean becomes available, a connection that is not present at lower water levels. The percent of low-lying area converted to marine inundation at the next higher water level was calculated for all the mapping methods. Generally, about 10–15% of the low-lying area becomes marine inundation when increasing from 1.25 ft (0.381 m) to 2.5 ft (0.762 m). More than 95% of low-lying areas convert to marine inundation when increasing water level from 2.5 ft (0.762 m) to 3.75 ft (1.143 m), which is likely a reflection of the overall low-relief nature of the atoll land.\\n\\nComparison of Figures 6 and 7 shows the effect of portraying different chances of inundation from the probabilistic mapping products. In this case, the projected area exposed to inundation decreases when thresholding the inundation probability grid (Figure 8) at 68% probability (33.62% of land, from Table 4) and then 95% probability (20.44% of land, from Table 4). The areas that remain in the projected inundation exposure are those that are at an elevation range below the specified water level even when cumulative vertical uncertainty of the DEM is factored in, while the areas that are removed by changing the probability threshold are high enough even when the error is included.\\n\\nThe source of marine inundation, either the lagoon-facing shore or the open ocean-facing shore, has also been identified through spatial processing. Such a distinction can be important for mitigation planning as differences in the character of the two types of shorelines have been identified [3] and both sources of inundation have been observed multiple times [18]. The elevation of the lagoon shoreline is generally lower, and it is less armored than the ocean-facing shoreline [18]. The results of marine inundation mapping distinguished by source support the previously identified differing shoreline characteristics. Of the 21 instances of marine inundation delineation (across all methods, water level increases, and confidence levels/probabilities), more than three-quarters (16 of 21) showed that lagoon inundation contributed a greater percent of the total marine inundation than did ocean inundation. In the five cases where the portion of ocean shore inundation exceeded lagoon inundation, three were at the highest water level (3.75 ft, or 1.143 m) and two at the 2.5 ft (0.762 m) water level. Also important are those cases where certain areas were identified as being exposed to marine inundation from both the lagoon-facing shore and the ocean-facing shore. The percentage of the total marine inundation that was included in both lagoon and ocean inundation was calculated for all delineations, and in all cases that percentage increased with increasing water level, which would be expected. The actual percentage varied according to mapping method and confidence level/probability. However, for any given instance of marine inundation delineation, these “combined” lagoon and ocean inundation areas are important because they reflect a greater degree of exposure. These areas are indicative of the narrow width of the land (and low relief) at specific locations along the atoll.\\n\\n#### Event-Based Inundation\\n\\nMany coastal inundation exposure assessments are aimed toward analysis of long-term, gradual changes along the shore because of sea-level rise. However, fast onset changes also can have substantial impacts on populations and resources in coastal environments. There have been discussions on the use of the terms for temporary conditions when dry areas become wet, either periodically or episodically, (“flooding”) and permanent conditions of submergence (“inundation”) [71]. Regardless of the terminology used, the concepts (for example, minimum increment of water level increase) and mapping methods described in this study are applicable to both gradual and fast onset water level increases. Figure 9 shows the results of an analysis of a projected water level increase event, in this case wave run-up, on the densely populated eastern end of Majuro Atoll. Wave run-up forecasts are routinely generated for Majuro and other islands by the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System (PacIOOS) [72]. The projected area subject to wave run-up was mapped with the deterministic and probabilistic methods, and the results demonstrate the increased information from the probabilistic.\\n---\\n#### Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 154\\n\\napproach. The deterministic method projected 43.40% of the forecast zone to be subject to impacts of the wave run-up, but this number has no quality information (confidence level or probability) associated with it. The probabilistic method delineated an area of 31.73% of the forecast zone with a 68% chance of flooding (Figure 9), and a projected area of 17.26% of land in the forecast zone having a 95% chance of flooding. Accounting for vertical uncertainty in the underlying elevation data used for spatial projections of such inundation events improves the flexibility and quality of the mapped information.\\n\\n#### Remote Sens. 2019, 11, x\\n\\nSpatial projection of potential area subject to forecast maximum wave run-up (dark blue)\\n\\nForecast peak: 8.26 ft (2.518 m) above MLLW 2018-02-16 17.23.14\\n68% probability of flooding: 8.26 ft (2.518 m) above low tide line Dark blue; marine inundation\\n\\nFigure 9.

Discussion\\n\\n#### 4.1. The Use of High-Accuracy Elevation Data for Coastal Assessments\\n\\nThe use of a high-resolution, high-accuracy DEM for coastal inundation exposure assessment has clear advantages, especially for a low-relief setting like Majuro Atoll, where the average elevation is less than 2 m above sea level [13]. Using a high-accuracy elevation dataset like the UAS-SfM DEM employed in this study, with a vertical uncertainty of better than 20 cm RMSE, allows modeling and projection of inundation with fine increments of water level increase at high confidence levels. Conversely, the use of global elevation models, which have been widely employed in such coastal assessments, leads to results with very low confidence [25]. SRTM in particular has been extensively used for coastal assessments [25], including studies that focus on island environments [9,10]. Often these studies use sea-level rise increments on the order of 1 or 2 m, which are well within the vertical error bounds of the SRTM DEM (Table 2). The use of such DEMs for inundation assessment is especially flawed for low-relief settings like Majuro Atoll, where the average land elevation is less than the inherent vertical uncertainty of SRTM: 1.80 m average elevation [13] versus 2.23 m RMSE (Table 2). Thus, the veracity of results is called into question for studies that project substantial island land loss (and corresponding impacts like displacement of populations) [9,10] from climate change-related sea-level rise. Testing with SRTM data for inundation mapping over Majuro Atoll confirms the severe limitations of such global DEMs. SRTM data were used in deterministic and modified deterministic approaches and the results, which reflect the characteristics of SRTM data, are very different than those derived from the UAS-SfM high-accuracy DEM. The deterministic results are the same for all\\n---\\n### Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 154\\n\\nloss (and corresponding impacts like displacement of populations) [9,10] from climate change-related sea-level rise.\\n\\nTesting with SRTM data for inundation mapping over Majuro Atoll confirms the severe limitations of such global DEMs. SRTM data were used in deterministic and modified deterministic approaches and the results, which reflect the characteristics of SRTM data, are very different than those derived from the UAS-SfM high-accuracy DEM. The deterministic results are the same for all three water level increase scenarios (3.60% of land above MHHW for marine inundation, and 0.90% of land for low-lying areas). These results reflect the fact that elevation values in the SRTM DEM are quantized to 1 m, while the water level intervals used are specified to the millimeter, and also that the SRTM data have a spatial resolution of about 30 m, thus limiting the detail of the shoreline that can be portrayed. The modified deterministic results with SRTM show a bit more variability than the deterministic results across the three water levels, but the projected areas are still much smaller than corresponding results from the UAS-SfM DEM. Some of the other DEMs available for Majuro have better vertical accuracy than SRTM, especially the DG-AES DEM (Table 2), but none are accurate enough to allow for use in modeling inundation increments on the order of a foot (0.3048 m) as can be done with the UAS-SfM DEM.\\n\\nImplications of Results for Vulnerability Assessments\\n\\nAccounting for vertical uncertainty is advantageous for the use of inundation exposure mapping in vulnerability assessments. Many elevation-based assessments of inundation or coastal flooding exposure have not considered the inherent vertical uncertainty, and users of such assessment results have no indication of the quality associated with the products and findings [25]. The comparison of the different inundation mapping methods documented here shows that the probabilistic approach handles vertical uncertainty most rigorously and provides the most flexibility in the use of output products (selectable probability levels for maps or statistics of areas exposed to inundation). However, the probabilistic approach does require access to sufficient computer resources for error propagation through Monte Carlo simulation, especially if input data have high spatial resolution, the study area is large, and multiple inundation scenarios are to be modeled. If probabilistic mapping is not practical or possible, then the modified deterministic approach is preferred, as it accounts for vertical uncertainty by bounding the elevation error and allows for presenting results with a specified confidence level. The simple deterministic method does not include any consideration of vertical uncertainty and therefore is not the best approach for use in inundation exposure assessments.\\n\\nFor areas included in the inundation exposure zone (by any of the methods), the DEM and specified water level can be used to generate a map of flood depth. Such a map may be especially important for projections of event-based inundation (see Section 3.2.2), where it could be advantageous to show the varying severity of the hazard according to location.\\n\\nThe delineations of areas exposed to inundation in this assessment of Majuro Atoll are restricted to modeling of hydrostatic inundation, otherwise termed still water or flat water inundation. The projected impact zones do not include the effects of dynamic coastal processes, such as wave run-up, coastal erosion, sediment accretion, storms, and groundwater hydrodynamics. Recent research results clearly show that inclusion of these factors is critical for highly accurate estimates of exposed area, population, and resources [8,73,74]. Until such factors can be added to an inundation exposure assessment, the current results represent the initial spatially accurate delineation of areas vulnerable to sea-level rise and coastal flooding events.\\n\\nLimitations and Caveats for the Use of Results\\n\\nIn addition to the limitation of hydrostatic modeling and exclusion of dynamic coastal processes, there are other known limiting factors for the assessment results. The UAS-SfM DEM used as the basis for inundation modeling has high vertical accuracy overall, but the accuracy does vary spatially primarily due to the presence of surface features, namely built structures and vegetation. The SfM process used to develop the DEM uses a point cloud derived from stereoscopic imagery, and if the\\n---\\n### Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 154\\n\\nground is not captured in the images then the point cloud, and subsequent DEM, will not include direct measurements of the ground elevation. In these cases, the ground elevations are interpolated based on nearby ground points, but in areas of dense vegetation (for instance, coconut trees) and large buildings the vertical accuracy can be degraded. In a low-relief setting like Majuro, where small changes in slope can affect water flow, these interpolated areas may not capture local land surface configuration as accurately as other areas where the UAS images captured the ground directly.\\n\\nAdditionally, not all flood protection barriers (seawalls, rip-rap) and drainage modifications that can affect water flow (ditches, culverts) are accurately portrayed in the DEM. Future improvements to the DEM used for inundation modeling should include addition of these features. Terrestrial, or ground-based, lidar (light detection and ranging) scanning is a useful source of high-resolution, high-accuracy elevation data that can be used to acquire these critical features for integration into an enhanced DEM [23,68,75].\\n\\nThe projected areas subject to inundation may be conservative (less extensive than actual conditions) due to the way in which local sea level datums were applied to the elevation model. As described previously, prior to inundation mapping the DEM was transformed to orthometric (mean sea level referenced) elevations from its native ellipsoid referenced vertical coordinates through application of a local geoid model. The geoid model was constructed from a local network of leveled benchmarks, which are tied to LMSL through a tidal benchmark for the Majuro tide gauge. The orthometric height of that tidal benchmark references LMSL as defined by tide records recorded in 1968–1969 [64]. However, as with many tide gauge locations, there is a rising trend in LMSL at the Majuro gauge [76], and LMSL is now about 7 in. (0.178 m) higher than it was in 1969 when the orthometric elevation reference for the leveled benchmarks was established. Thus, the local geoid used to apply orthometric height referencing to the DEM represents a lower LMSL than current conditions. The net effect is that the DEM is slightly lower relative to current LMSL; therefore, any inundation area projections also are lower, in a vertical sense, on the landscape. One simple test was conducted to check the type of effects possible on inundated area projections. Using 2.5 ft (0.762 m) of marine inundation in the modified deterministic method (minimum extent) resulted in an increase of 13% in exposed land area when incorporating an increase of nearly 7 inches (0.178 m) to LMSL. Updating of the LMSL referencing of the DEM is a future enhancement to be considered.\\n\\nThe increased water levels used in this study (1.25 ft, 2.5 ft, and 3.75 ft, or 0.381 m, 0.762 m, and 1.143 m, respectively) do not have a specific date associated with them in the context of sea-level rise rates, but rather are plausible increases that help illustrate potential impacts to aid in mitigation planning. The current mean sea level trend at the Majuro tide station is 3.60 mm/yr [76], which is close to the global mean sea level trend and equates to a change of 1.18 ft (0.360 m) in 100 years. However, projections of sea-level rise in the second half of the century show accelerated rates across the equatorial Pacific Ocean [15,16], and so the higher increments may be realized by 2100 due primarily to contributions from Antarctica ice melt [77].\\n\\n#### 5. Conclusions\\n\\nLike many other low-lying oceanic islands, Majuro Atoll is vulnerable to coastal inundation, whether the source of increased water levels is sea-level rise or fast onset events. Coarse-scale vulnerability assessments that include these islands have been conducted, but the results are severely limited for use in local-scale planning. Detailed information on the topography is critical for assessing coastal inundation exposure, but the lack of appropriate elevation data is often a constraint for many studies. A high-resolution, high-accuracy DEM derived from UAS imagery using SfM techniques has proven useful for conducting a first ever detailed, spatially explicit quantitative inundation exposure assessment for Majuro Atoll, RMI. The high vertical accuracy afforded by the DEM is especially important for a low-relief setting like Majuro Atoll, where a relatively small increase in coastal water level can have large effects.\\n---\\nWhile the DEM used for this assessment does have high vertical accuracy, it still carries vertical uncertainty, as all elevation datasets do, and the most effective mapping methods rigorously account for that uncertainty. By properly considering the inherent vertical uncertainty, the inundation modeling results are expressed with specified confidence levels or probabilities that provide the user with data quality information. For this study, the probabilistic mapping approach provided results with the most flexibility (for example, selectable risk levels). For the middle of three water levels modeled, 2.5 ft (0.762 m), an amount of sea-level rise quite plausible by the end of the current century, more than 13% of the atoll study area has a 68% chance of being exposed to the effects of coastal inundation. In IPCC terms, the inundation of this area is “Likely.” At 95% chance of inundation, or what IPCC calls “Extremely likely,” more than 7% of the atoll study area will be exposed. At the highest water level modeled, 3.75 ft (1.143 m), more than 34% of the atoll study area is likely to be exposed to inundation (68% chance or greater), while more than 20% of the atoll is extremely likely to be exposed (95% chance or greater).\\n\\nAtolls are subject to multiple threats from increasing coastal water levels [1], and these highly dynamic landforms [4] require detailed topographic mapping, and subsequent monitoring, so that geomorphic changes can be understood in the context of sea-level rise to inform adaptation planning [78]. To meet the critical need for detailed, high-accuracy elevation information required for coastal assessments, the UAS approach used to develop the DEM employed in this study is an appealing, cost-effective alternative to manned airborne systems that can have significant logistical challenges operating in remote, isolated locations [13]. Also, UAS and associated SfM methods are technologies that can be effectively acquired and employed by local entities in the island communities that need improved mapping for adaptation planning.\\n\\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/1/154/s1.\\n\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.G., C.F., J.D., and M.P.-L.; Methodology, D.G., M.P.-L., J.D., C.F., M.B., M.K., and A.J.; Software, J.D., D.G., and M.P.-L.; Validation, D.G., M.P.-L., and J.D.; Formal Analysis, D.G., M.P.-L., and C.F.; Investigation, D.G., J.D., and M.P.-L.; Data Curation, J.D., D.G., M.K., and A.J.; Writing—Original Draft Preparation, D.G.; Writing—Review and Editing, D.G., M.P.-L., J.D., C.F., M.K., M.B., and A.J.; Visualization, D.G. and M.P.-L.; Project Administration, J.D., and D.G..; Funding Acquisition, C.F., J.D., and D.G.

Introduction\\n\\nBeaches are highly dynamic systems, constantly changing in response to environmental processes, including long-term sea level rise. As many of the world’s beaches abut urban and suburban areas, it is necessary to improve understanding of beach behavior on a range of temporal and spatial scales. Waik¯ık¯ı, located on the southern shore of O‘ahu, functions as the premier resort destination of the Hawaiian Islands generating an estimated USD 2.2 billion in visitor expenditure per year while also serving as a cultural and recreational hub for both visitors and residents alike.\\n---\\n## Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5108\\n\\nSome 70 percent of beaches in Hawai‘i are chronically eroding due to both natural and anthropogenic causes [3]. Year-to-year erosion in Waik¯ık¯ı has required regular intervention to retain sediment and maintain beach area for more than a century [4], and in turn the location has been the subject of multiple scientific studies to inform such projects [5–7]. Until recently, however, traditional beach surveying methods have limited the spatial and temporal resolution of research and thus hampered understanding of more nuanced beach processes. With the advent of consumer-grade small uncrewed aerial systems (sUASs) coupled with modern structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry software, there is potential to understand beach behavior at a higher level of complexity and detail.\\n\\nCoastal research using remote sensing platforms has been a rapidly evolving area of study. Early use of remote sensing techniques relied on time series of aerial and/or satellite imagery to determine temporal patterns of shoreline change and remains a useful method [8–14]. The development of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) techniques allowed for the study of three-dimensional subaerial and nearshore coastal variability [15,16], but such methods are often cost prohibitive. High-frequency sampling intervals can be achieved with coastal monitoring stations, such as the ARGUS system [17], but require infrastructure and maintenance and can be subject to high vertical uncertainty [18].\\n\\nIn the mid-2000s, sUASs were more regularly employed in the study of coastal environments owing to their operational flexibility and versatility [19,20]. Lower costs, associated with the growing demand for consumer-grade sUASs, and improved accuracy relative to traditional survey methods [21] have made these platforms practical for studying coastal morphodynamics [22–26]. However, despite the capacity to collect data at higher (e.g., weekly, daily, etc.) temporal resolutions, there are few published studies of beach dynamics using sUASs at these frequencies [27].\\n\\nTypical coastal monitoring methods have focused on broad-scale beach response and morphological change [16,28,29]. Here, we employ a modified methodology using sUASs that reduces field time when compared to traditional methods, allowing for rapid data collection at approximately weekly intervals. The method produces three-dimensional reconstructions, or point clouds, of the subaerial beach that feature high spatial resolution using SfM analyses. Digital elevation models (DEMs) produced from these point clouds are then compared to gain insight into morphological change during the study period.\\n\\nDEMs time-series analysis is a widely employed method to document morphological change and quantify earth surface processes across a range of time and spatial scales. It is often used to model change in a variety of different environments, from riparian [30,31], volcanic [32,33], and glacial settings [34–37] to earth mineral extraction sites [38–40] and the extraterrestrial [41]. DEMs, or bare-earth raster grids, are referenced to a vertical datum, allowing them to be compared on a cell-by-cell level, often through differencing or other statistical means [42,43].\\n\\nWe conduct empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses across the DEM time series and interpret patterns of beach behavior and relationships to environmental data across the period of study. EOF analyses are commonly used across various disciplines to investigate spatial patterns of variability and how they change over time. Such analyses are typically conducted by computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a covariance matrix (representing spatial and temporal data that capture elevation change in this case) in which derived eigenvalues provide a measure of percent variance explained by each mode.\\n\\nThe objectives of this study are (1) to identify patterns of morphological variability that have not previously been captured by studies featuring lower temporal and spatial resolution, (2) to interpret patterns of beach change using EOF analysis and identify correlations with long-term and episodic environmental forcing, and (3) to advance understanding of morphodynamics on reef-fronted beaches to inform beach management.\\n\\n## 2.

Site Description\\n\\nRoyal Hawaiian Beach is a crescent-shaped, carbonate sand beach located in the heart of Waikīkī. The beach’s littoral cell extends 520 m and is bounded by terminal groin structures located at each end that function as artificial headlands and prevent significant longshore transport into or out of the system. Any net sediment gains or losses occur primarily through cross-shore transport; however, pronounced longshore sediment exchange within the cell does create localized erosion and accretion hotspots depending on fluctuations in the wave field.\\n\\nSediment in the study area is characterized as moderately well to well-sorted medium sand (D50: 0.29–0.40 mm), with notably coarser grains near the terminal groins (D50: 0.80 mm). Royal Hawaiian Beach has a long history of sand nourishment. In 2012, the State of Hawai‘i brought 17,551 m3 of carbonate sand from a reef-top borrow site located approximately 200 m offshore; a follow-up restoration project was conducted in 2021 following our period of study.\\n\\nThe nearshore is characterized by a wide and relatively shallow (1–3 m in depth) carbonate reef platform, an irregular patchwork of fossil reef outcrops separated by mobile and generally thin (<1 m-thick) sand deposits, extending more than 1000 m offshore. The platform is bisected by a shallow submarine sand field occupying a paleo-channel. This sand field acts as a conduit for cross-shore transport, contributing to an average shoreline erosion rate of 0.7 m/year and annual sediment loss of about 1070 m3. The complex bathymetry produces complicated wave and current conditions. Previous studies have shown that a wave-induced longshore current typically flows to the northwest (toward the bottom of Figure 1) at velocities generally below 0.15 m/s. However, this current reverses on occasion due to seasonal changes in swell direction.\\n\\nDominant swell regimes for the Hawaiian Islands coincide with the seasons. Southerly swells generated by storms in the southern hemisphere represent the greatest source of wave energy to the study site. These waves are most prevalent between April and October, occurring 53 percent of the time during a typical year. Often traveling more than 8000 km, they have deep-water wave heights ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 m, with periods of 14 to 20 s. Wave direction depends on storm position and track, with resulting swells typically approaching from between the southeast to southwest. Locally generated\\n---\\n## Remote Sens. 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW\\n\\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5108 more than 8000 km, they have deep-water wave heights ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 m, with periods of 14 to 20 s [44]. Wave direction depends on storm position and track, with resulting swells typically approaching from between the southeast to southwest. Locally generated waves resulting from trade winds blowing from the east or northeast occur 75 percent of the time during a typical year [48] and are most persistent through summer months [44]. Deep-water wave heights associated with trade-wind waves are typically 0.9 to 2.4 m with periods of 5 to 10 s. The study area, in the lee of the island, is mostly sheltered from this energy, although some trade-wind wave energy is refracted around the southeastern end of the island [44].\\n\\nNORTH PACIFIC SWELL\\n\\n| |2820|2 m|2589|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| | |4 M|KONA STORM|1470|1470|1238|\\n| | | |6 m|210\"|WAVES|\\n\\nAnnual Significant Wave Height Figure 2. Dominant swell regimes for the Hawaiian Islands. Southerly swell generated by storms in the southern hemisphere represents the greatest source of wave energy to the Royal Hawaiian Beach. Occasionally, storm-generated waves can affect the Waikīkī area via Kona storms or tropical cyclones. Refracted wave energy due to locally generated northeasterly wind-driven waves is also capable of influencing the study site. Northerly swells, typical during the winter season, are mostly blocked by the island and have little influence on the beaches of Waikīkī; however, swells with an extreme westerly or easterly direction may generate some refracted energy into the cell.

Fletcher.\\n\\nStorm-generated waves and changes in wind direction also affect the Waikīkī area via seasonal extratropical and tropical cyclones. The extratropical cyclones occur near the islands during the Northern Hemisphere cool season as disturbances of extratropical origin propagate towards the equator and spawn disturbances at subtropical latitudes; in the Hawaiian Islands, these disturbances are referred to as Kona storms [51]. Kona storms occur 10 percent of the time during a typical year [48] and are associated with strong southerly and southwesterly winds capable of generating deep-water wave heights of 1 m with larger waves ranging from 3 to 5 m and periods of 8 to 10 s [47]. Tropical cyclones\\n---\\n## Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5108\\n\\nWaves ranging from 3 to 5 m and periods of 8 to 10 s [47]. Tropical cyclones generally occur near the islands during the Northern Hemisphere warm season as disturbances of tropical origin spawn in the eastern or central Pacific Ocean. Tropical disturbances that travel west into the Central North Pacific basin often pass south of the islands and can produce large surf in the study area. Modeling suggests that potential impacts of global warming on regional cyclone activity include a northwestern shift of regional hurricane tracks such that tropical systems will likely encounter Hawaiian waters more frequently in the future [52].\\n\\nThe 2018 hurricane season was the fourth most active season on record, producing the highest accumulated cyclone energy value in the Central Pacific basin [53]. Four named storms impacted the study site during our monitoring period (Table 1, Figure 3). Hurricane Hector reached Category 4 intensity and passed south of O‘ahu in early August, generating deep-water waves that peaked at 1.25 m in height from a south-southwesterly direction (200◦–213◦). Hurricane Lane occurred at the end of August and attained Category 5 intensity, generating the largest swell of the study period with deep-water heights of just over 2 m from the south-southwest (190◦–210◦). Hurricane Olivia attained Category 4 intensity and passed just to the south of the study area in mid-September as it weakened into a tropical storm. As it passed, Olivia produced torrential rainfall and tropical-storm-force winds that impacted O‘ahu and other islands; however, the event produced only minor swell relative to the other three systems. Hurricane Walaka passed to the south of the study area in late September and early October and attained Category 5 intensity as it tracked to the southwest. This storm produced the second largest swell of the study period with peak deep-water heights just under 2 m from a southwesterly direction (210◦–227◦).\\n\\n|Tropical Cyclone|Dates of Influence|Peak Intensity|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Hurricane Hector|9 August 2018–15 August 2018|Category 4, 250 km/h|\\n|Hurricane Lane|20 August 2018–27 August 2018|Category 5, 259 km/h|\\n|Tropical Storm Olivia|10 September 2018–14 September 2018|Category 4, 213 km/h|\\n|Hurricane Walaka|2 October 2018–6 October 2018|Category 5, 259 km/h|\\n\\nNortherly swells, generated by winter storms in the northern hemisphere, produce deep-water wave heights as great as 9 m at periods of 12 to 20 s [44] but are mostly blocked by the island and have little influence on the beaches of Waik¯ık¯ı.

Additionally, the sensor utilizes a global shutter, meaning that all pixels of the image sensor array are exposed simultaneously, enabling the capture of moving targets without the spatial distortion that can be experienced from rolling shutters of previous Phantom model sensors. This results in improved accuracy and reduced image processing times [61].\\n\\nFlights were semi-automated using the flight planning software package DroneDeploy that collected still imagery with 80 percent overlap in both x and y. Flight height was set at 120 m above launch elevation, allowing clearance of buildings and other structures while optimizing image resolution and maintaining Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airspace compliance. Owing to small variations in beach elevation of less than 4 m, the ground sample distance remained between 115 m and 120 m for all surveys. Camera parameters were dependent on conditions and lighting, but high shutter speeds (1/1000–1/600) were used to reduce motion blur of objects and distortion introduced by the movement of the image collection system.\\n\\nSeven 1 × 1 m vinyl targets were placed at approximately equidistant intervals along the length of the subaerial beach and functioned as ground control for each aerial survey. Ground control points were surveyed in the field using a rod-mounted prism and a Leica TS16 Robotic Total Station. Surveying was accomplished early in the day to avoid the hours of heavy public use; thus, conditions were random with respect to wave state and tide cycle. Existing benchmarks were used to orient the spatial reference using the WGS 1984 UTM Zone 4 projection. Elevations were measured with respect to local mean sea level (LMSL) [62].\\n\\n### 3.2. Three-Dimensional Beach Reconstruction\\n\\nPoint clouds and orthomosaics were produced using Photoscan (now Metashape), a photogrammetric processing application developed by Agisoft LLC. The process generally follows a methodology developed by the United States Geological Society [63] in which imagery taken by sUASs is combined with surveyed control points in an iterative process to reduce errors and produce map-quality three-dimensional surface reconstructions. Points in the sparse point cloud model generated via the initial photo alignment are assigned uncertainty values, namely reconstruction uncertainty, projection accuracy, and reprojection error, by the software. Points above a designated threshold were removed after which the point cloud was realigned. This process was repeated until the error values were at or below the designated threshold. The dense point clouds produced from the best available points as determined through this process were then exported for additional processing using Rapidlasso’s LAStools, a software suite allowing for batch-scriptable, multi-core processing of point cloud data. The automated LAStools processing involved standard remotely sensed data processing (e.g., masking, thinning, and classifying) of the point cloud in addition to the removal of stationary objects along the beach (e.g., beach umbrellas and canoes) and noise introduced at the foreshore due to saturated sand and wave run-up. Manual assessment and removal of any residual noise were conducted for each post-processed point cloud.\\n\\nPost-processed point clouds were imported into ESRI’s ArcMap, following which DEMs with 0.5 m resolutions were generated using natural neighbor interpolation. The DEMs were smoothed using mean cell values located within a 5 m radius circular neighborhood to reduce noise and to reveal larger-scale patterns of variability. The DEM time series was used for all analyses including width, volume, surface area, surface variability, and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis.\\n\\n### 3.3. Beach Width, Volume, and Surface Area\\n\\nBeach width, volume, and surface area were calculated for the subaerial (dry) beach above the mean higher high water (MHHW) tidal elevation. MHHW, which is measured at 0.329 m above LMSL at the nearby Honolulu tide gauge [62], is used to represent an upper\\n---\\n### 3.4. Uncertainty\\n\\nTo quantify error in the sUAS-derived DEMs, a separate survey was conducted, in which a total of 228 elevation measurements were taken randomly throughout the study area using a Leica TS16 Robotic Total Station, which results in mm-level accuracy. Simultaneously, sUAS imagery and ground control points were collected, from which a DEM was created following the methods presented in this study.\\n\\nErrors in DEM elevations were calculated by taking the measured total station elevations, assumed as accurate, and subtracting from them from the respective DEM elevations representing the same location. The mean of the discrepancies between the total station elevations and the model was effectively zero (0.006 m), and measured locations were sufficiently spaced such that there were no observed spatial correlations between adjacent error values. Thus, the measured errors are considered to be randomly distributed about a mean of zero, and the standard deviation of the mean of errors, σµ = √σn, was used in the uncertainty calculations and determined to be 0.007 m, where σ is the standard deviation of the errors themselves (0.1 m, RMSE = 0.1 m), and n is the number of total station elevation measurements.\\n\\nFrom these randomly distributed errors, the uncertainty in beach width and surface area was quantified by determining the upper and lower bounds of the beach. The smaller bound represented the width and surface area of the beach whose seaward edge intersected the MHHW + σµ elevation contour; the width and surface area of the beach whose seaward edge intersected the MHHW − σµ constituted the larger bound. Beach width and surface area uncertainty were then calculated as one-half the distance/difference in area representing the smaller and larger bound, respectively.\\n\\nThe uncertainty in sediment volume from each DEM is estimated as Uvol j = Ajσµ where Aj is the footprint, or area, of the jth sUAV-derived DEM of the subaerial beach, and σµ is the standard deviation of the mean of errors, as described above.\\n\\n### 3.5. Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis\\n\\nEmpirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was used to quantify spatiotemporal modes of variability of the subaerial beach. EOF analysis is a common method of multivariate analysis that is highly useful in revealing dominant modes of variability within datasets, such as those that capture beach profile evolution [7,60,65–69]. As is standard in EOF analysis, the time average was removed in order to describe variations from the mean beach. Our analysis focuses on the first three modes of variability which represent 74 percent of the total data variance.\\n\\n### 3.6.

Shoreline Response to Wave Forcing\\n\\nBeach volume and surface area calculations, DEM surfaces, and EOF modes of variability were compared to regional wave and wind conditions to determine morphological response of the beach. Data describing local wave and wind conditions are hosted by PacIOOS (www.pacioos.org, accessed on 3 December 2018), which is part of the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System, funded in part by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data sourced from PacIOOS are described hereafter. Regional hourly modeled significant wave height, mean direction, and mean period were acquired from the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) Regional Wave Model for the island of Oʻahu (Figure 4a–c). The high-resolution (500 m) SWAN model simulates shallow water effects and nearshore coastal dynamics with a 7-day output [70]. Regional hourly wind speed and direction were obtained from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a 1.5 km resolution open-source numerical weather prediction system (Figure 4d,e). The data were obtained for the grid cell most proximate to the study area (21.27°N, 157.827°W). A proxy for wave energy flux generated by southern hemisphere swell (wave periods: 14–30 s; wave direction: 147–220°N) and locally generated trade-wind waves (wave periods: 3–10 s; wave direction: 45–160°N) were calculated following Mikkelsen et al.

Losses in area and volume coincide with increases in trade-wind energy flux above a threshold of approximately 1 × 105 W/m2. Gains in area and volume coincide with south swell energy flux above a threshold of approximately 1.5 × 104 W/m2.\\n\\n## 4. Results\\n\\n### 4.1. Variation in Beach Width\\n\\nTo identify variations in beach width over the study period, the mean widths of the 98 transects were removed from corresponding beach width measurements and plotted with respect to survey date and transect location (Figure 6). It was found that transect widths fluctuated throughout the study period, varying from respective means by as much as 3.5 m (Figure 7). Most transects from surveys conducted early in the time series (April–June) were narrower than their respective means, particularly at the western end (transects 1 to 30) and just east of the central region (transects 55 to 85) of the study area; however, widths were slightly wider than their respective means just to the east of each of these regions. The width patterns indicate beach behavior acting as two separate littoral subcells during this time period, in which dual cell activity corresponds with periods of\\n---\\nspots located at the easternmost and westernmost ends, respectively. The abrupt beginning of clear single cell behavior coincides with passage of Hurricane Hector, the first hurricane of the season to pass the study area, and ends following passage of Hurricane Walaka, the season’s final hurricane to pass the study area. Following strong trade-wind Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5108 activity affiliated with Tropical Storm Olivia, transects 25 to 70 experienced abrupt increases in erosion and associated accretion along transects 1 to 24.

To determine beach width, transects were cast at 5-m intervals along the beach. Beach width was defined as the distance between the seaward edge of the beach (where the beach surface intersects the MHHW elevation) and the inland edge of the beach (typically identified by cement walkways or other engineered structures) and calculated for each transect. The above figure represents transect IDs for the study area. For reference, Transect 0 is located at the west end of the study area adjacent to Royal Hawaiian Groin, while Transect 97 is at the east end adjacent to K¯ uhi¯ o Groin.

The single cell behavior is demonstrated by erosive/accretive hot spots located at the easternmost and westernmost ends, respectively. The abrupt beginning of clear single cell behavior coincides with passage of Hurricane Hector, the first hurricane of the season to pass the study area, and ends following passage of Hurricane Walaka, the season’s final hurricane to pass the study area.

Orthomosaic basemap generated from the 15 May 2018 aerial section of the beach and associated accretion to the west from transects 1 to 24. Each of these events featured trade-wind energy flux exceeding 1.5 × 105 W/m2 (Figure 5c).\\n\\nFigure 7. The above figure represents differences from mean beach width for each transect across the DEM time series. Each grid cell corresponds to one transect (x-axis) on a particular survey date (y-axis), while the colors correspond to widths narrower than the mean (red) and widths wider than the mean (blue). The first survey is represented by the bottom row, and subsequent surveys are represented by each row above thereafter. For spatial reference with Figure 1, Transect 0 is represented by the leftmost column. Most transects early in the time series were narrower than their means, but this pattern gradually shifted during the second half of the survey period as beach width increased.\\n\\n### 4.2. Changes in Surface Area and Volume\\n\\nTo gain additional perspective on forcing related to wind and wave characteristics, we examined changes in subaerial beach area and volume over the monitoring period relative to the initial survey (Figures 4 and 5). Overall, we found a gradual increase in area and volume throughout the time series: the beach gained 708.5 ± 43.5 m2 (area) and 1384.8 ± 102.2 m3 (volume). This trend was not unexpected as the period of study aligned with seasons of known accretion previously observed within the study area [7]. The overall trend of accretion was interrupted by short-lived erosion events, following which the overall accretion continued. The rate of recovery differed after each erosion event, but recovery within 1–3 weeks was typical. As the beach accreted and eroded, the surface area and volume trends were approximately consistent with respect to each other, particularly during the first half of the study period. During the second half of the study period, more pronounced increases and decreases in surface area led to a slight relative decoupling of the trends between the two metrics, which may be related to variations in beach slope.\\n\\nRelationships between forcing (wind and wave conditions) and beach response are evident when comparing metrics of area and volume change to variations in south swell and trade-wind energy flux (Figure 5b,c). Losses in area and volume coincide with increases in trade-wind energy flux above a threshold of approximately 1 × 105 W/m2; five events illustrate this relationship (late April, early July, early to mid-September, late October, and mid-November). Gains in area and volume coincide with south swell energy flux above a threshold of approximately 1.5 × 104 W/m2 in which four events illustrate this relationship (mid-May through late June, mid-August, late August, and early October). Increases in south swell energy flux during the study period were generated by seasonal south swell events and by locally generated hurricane swells apart from Tropical Storm Olivia, which, unlike the other three storm events, did not produce swell and instead led to increased wind speeds exceeding 4 m per second. Volume gains were especially notable during periods in which south swell energy flux above the identified threshold coincided with periods of trade-wind energy flux of less than 0.25 × 105 W/m2; however, when wave energy flux exceeding the given threshold coincided with trade-wind energy flux exceeding 1 × 105 W/m2, losses in surface area and volume occurred as observed during early July. These findings are consistent with those of Mikkelsen et al. (2022) [27]\\n---\\nDuring periods in which south swell energy flux above the identified threshold coincided with periods of trade-wind energy flux of less than 0.25 × 105 W/m2; however, when wave energy flux exceeding the given threshold coincided with trade-wind energy flux exceeding 1 × 105 W/m2, losses in surface area and volume occurred as observed during early July. These findings are consistent with those of Mikkelsen et al. (2022) [27] that identified correlations between erosional events and peaks in trade-wind swell and correlations between accretional events and increases in south swell energy flux.\\n\\n4.3. Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis\\n\\nFigure 8a–f depicts the results of EOF analysis including three principal spatial modes and their respective temporal components. Together, the three modes represent 74 percent of the topographic variability observed throughout the monitoring period. We interpret vertical changes in beach topography as inflation (accretion, blue) and deflation (erosion, red) when coupled with a positive temporal coefficient, and the opposite (erosion, blue; accretion, red) when coupled with a negative temporal coefficient.\\n\\n|EOF Mode|variability| |Coatticient 1|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|EOF Mode| | |Temcoml Coattident ?|\\n|EQF Mode|variabinty| |Temporal Coetficient 3|\\n\\nFigure 8. The first three spatial modes (a,c,e) and their respective temporal coefficients (b,d,f) of the EOF analysis, representing 74 percent of the variability of the study area during the study period. We interpret vertical changes in beach topography as inflation (accretion, blue) and deflation (erosion, red) when coupled with a positive temporal coefficient (above the dotted line), and the opposite (erosion, blue; accretion, red) when coupled with a negative temporal coefficient (below the dotted line).\\n\\nThe first spatial mode (Figure 8a) represents 51 percent of the topographic variability observed throughout the monitoring period. The mode reveals two distinct regions with similar patterns of erosion/accretion located along the eastern and western sectors of the study area, respectively. We interpret these as distinct littoral “subcells”, which demonstrate nearly identical patterns of behavior. The adjacent positions of eroding and accreting sections within each subcell suggest that eroding portions may be acting as sand sources to the accreting portions, likely driven by longshore littoral transport known to occur within the study area [6,7]. The overall westward rotation of both subcells, as illustrated by the spatial mode and overall positive trending temporal coefficient (Figure 8b), tends to coincide with mild trade-wind energy flux below approximately 1 × 105 W/m2 threshold, in which deviations in the temporal coefficient coincide with trade-wind energy flux above this threshold. Specifically, such deviations occur in early May, early July, early to mid-\\n---\\n## Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5108\\n\\nSeptember, late October, and mid-November of 2018. In each case, deviations correspond to losses in beach area and volume and correspond to positive trends in temporal coefficients of EOF modes 2 and 3, which suggests that distinct changes in behavior occur when this threshold in trade-wind energy flux is exceeded.\\n\\nThe second EOF mode (Figure 8c,d) represents 12 percent of the topographic variability observed throughout the monitoring period. Like the first spatial mode, two subcells are apparent. However, unlike the behavior of EOF mode 1, the sediment transport patterns revealed in the second spatial mode mirror rather than mimic each other. Here again, the two subcells share a boundary near the center of the study area in which the positive and negative representations of the mode respectively represent inflation/deflation of the central section of the beach and deflation/inflation adjacent to the artificial headlands (i.e., groins). The temporal coefficient of mode 2 (Figure 8d) is punctuated by abrupt negative trends that coincide with periods of increased south swell wave energy flux and by abrupt positive trends that coincide with periods of increased trade-wind energy flux. Negative trends correspond to events including extended large south swell that occurred during the first half of June and as part of elevated swell generated by Hurricanes Hector, Lane, and Walaka. Positive trends occurred corresponding to elevated periods of trade-wind energy flux generated by Tropical Storm Olivia and during periods of elevated trade winds in late October and November.\\n\\nRepresenting 11 percent of the total variability, we interpret the third spatial mode (Figure 8e) as representing one single cell spanning the greater littoral system. The coupled spatial and temporal pattern (Figure 8f) illustrates overall westward rotation during periods in which trade-wind energy flux exceeds an approximate threshold of 1 × 105 W/m2 and/or when wave energy flux increases in combination with a wave approach that is near normal to or relatively east of normal to the shoreline orientation. Reversals in rotation tend to occur as south swell wave energy flux increases in combination with wave approach that is relatively west of normal to the shoreline orientation. An example of such reversal occurred in response to swell originating from an SSW direction generated by Hurricane Walaka, which resulted in a reversal in sand transport direction from west to east.\\n\\n### 5. Discussion\\n\\nPrevious studies of Royal Hawaiian Beach [6,7,47] that employed data of coarser spatial and temporal resolution concluded that the beach operated mainly as a single littoral cell. It was found that the predominant behavior could be described by reversals in transport direction driven by seasonal changes in wave energy and direction. It was also found by these studies that the beach generally features erosion during the winter season along with sediment transport to the east and accretion during the summer season along with sediment transport to the west coinciding with the onset of southerly swells [5,6]. Similar to the present study, Habel et al. (2016) [7] employed EOF analysis to identify the described sediment transport patterns. However, their methods consisted of traditional elevation surveys conducted quarterly during their study period, representing topographic data of lower temporal and spatial resolution relative to the present study. While Habel et al. (2016) [7] were able to establish overarching patterns of seasonal sediment transport, the investigation was limited in its ability to analyze behavior coinciding with more specific wind and wave regimes. Further, the behavior revealed by primary EOF modes was dominated by the 2012 beach nourishment event and subsequent equilibration that the study was designed to monitor and thus did not capture the relatively subtle naturally driven behavior of the littoral cell.\\n\\nThe use of EOF analysis in combination with higher resolution data and the absence of large beach management projects such as the 2012 nourishment revealed subtle modes of beach behavior that highlight more complex patterns of sediment exchange. These consist of combinations of single and dual cell activity that drive the overall morphodynamics of the study area. Overall, the predominant behavior over the surveyed time period has been revealed as dual cell rotation to the west according to the principle EOF mode (Figure 8a).\\n---\\n## Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5108\\n\\nThis mode accounts for approximately half the topographic variability observed and features an overall positive trend in the temporal coefficient (Figure 8b). Further, transport direction and approximate alignment with the prevailing ENE trade-wind regime suggest that the behavior is generated by mild ENE trade winds and in turn trade-wind energy flux that contributes to the dual cell longshore transport processes. Genesis of the dual cell activity and basis for the location of their division remain unclear; however, these may be related to the disruption in longshore activity due to cross-shore currents related to the non-linear shoreline orientation and/or presence of a centrally located offshore channel, as described in Section 5.2.\\n\\n5.1. Trade-Wind-Driven Transition from Dual Cell to Single Cell Behavior and Generation of Cross-Shore Transport Patterns\\n\\nIncreases in ENE trade-wind speed, and in turn trade-wind flux above the threshold of approximately 1 × 105 W/m2, shift beach behavior from dual cell westward rotation to single cell westward rotation as indicated by reversals in the temporal coefficient of EOF mode 1 (Figure 8b) and corresponding positive trends in the temporal coefficient of EOF mode 3 (Figure 8f). This suggests that as winds exceed the stated threshold, centrally located disruptions in longshore transport are overcome, initiating single cell transport behavior.\\n\\nIncreases in trade-wind energy flux above the stated threshold also correspond to losses in overall beach area and volume and positive trends in the temporal coefficient of EOF mode 2 (Figure 8d), suggesting generation of cross-shore sediment transport in the offshore direction. For example, two episodes of increased trade-wind energy flux, one in late May and the other generated by Tropical Storm Olivia in mid-September, correspond to relatively large erosion events and increasing trends in the temporal coefficients of EOF modes 2 and 3. In late May, 964.2 ± 97.5 m3 of sediment were eroded, and in September, 1233.0 ± 103.7 m3 were lost. These findings reinforce and explain the Mikkelsen et al. (2022) [27] finding that high windspeed trade winds drive accelerated erosion on the eastern beach extent and reduced accretion on the western beach end, as well as the finding that strong wind speeds alter predominant longshore and cross-shore currents.\\n\\nWhile erosion tended to be influenced by increases in trade-wind energy flux, accretion appeared to be driven by increases in south swell energy flux. The presence of hurricane-related swell coincides with increases in overall surface area over relatively short time periods. From the beginning of August to mid-October, three named storm events (Hurricanes Hector, Lane, and Walaka) produced sizable swell that coincided with approximately doubled surface area of the overall beach from ~400 m2 to ~900 m2 across the respective time period. These increases in area and volume correspond with negative shifts in EOF mode 2, suggesting the influence of cross-shore sediment transport in the onshore direction as wave energy flux exceeded 2.5 × 104 W/m2. These findings identify south swell wave energy flux approximately exceeding this threshold as the driver of cross-shore transport in the onshore direction, answering a question left unconfirmed by Habel et al. (2016) [7] which speculated that increases in beach volume coincide with increased incident wave energy flux during the summer months. While the reasons for this phenomenon require further study, we hypothesize that sediment eroded from the beach during the winter months settles in the centrally located offshore channel. As south swells influence the area during summer months, particularly those that exceed the wave energy flux as described above, waves propagate through the channel creating the cross-shore currents in the onshore direction, leading to sediment deposition along the beach and increases in surface area and volume. A more detailed discussion regarding the formation of these currents can be found in the following section.\\n\\n5.2. Alternating Rip-Current Formation\\n\\nTopographic gains along the central beach extent and moderate losses near the terminal structures, as indicated by the spatial component of EOF mode 2 (Figure 8c), suggest the formation of rip currents as wave energy travels landward through the centrally\\n---\\n## Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5108\\n\\nlocated offshore channel and returns seaward near the eastern and westernmost terminal structures. Such rip currents are known to form in the center of embayments and adjacent to headlands [73] both of which are featured in the study area. Cross-shore sediment transport is suggested by patterns of topographic loss in the central section of beach that correspond to increases in trade-wind energy flux and overall beach volume/area loss. Cross-shore transport is also suggested by patterns of topographic gains in the same area that correspond to increases in south swell energy flux and overall beach volume/area gain. Abrupt variations in the temporal component of EOF mode 2 (Figure 8d) in which positive trends correspond to increases in trade-wind energy flux and negative trends correspond to increases in south swell energy flux suggest that rip currents form at the center of the embayment during elevated periods of trade-wind energy flux and adjacent to artificial headlands (i.e., groins) during elevated periods of south swell. Topographic gains in areas opposite to those experiencing loss may suggest the presence of feeder currents running adjacent to rip currents, causing accretion landward of those areas.\\n\\nSouth swell energy flux in the form of large-wave-inducing far-field storms and hurricanes and trade-wind energy flux in the form of a wind-inducing near-field tropical storm provide extreme examples of how episodic wave and wind events likely generate cross-shore sediment transport in both onshore and offshore directions within the study area. Such information regarding rip-current generation and location is useful to decision makers overseeing beach use and safety. Past studies have verified that (1) currents move through the centrally located channel, which acts as a conduit through which cross-shore sediment transport occurs, and (2) that currents have been observed in this channel featuring velocities of over 0.9 m/s [47]. Novel to this study is the recognition that cross-shore current reversals (i.e., rip-current formation and location) likely occur in accordance with relatively predictable wind- and wave-generated swell.\\n\\n### 5.3. South Swell Energy Flux an Additional Driver of Single Cell Behavior\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the transition from single to dual cell behavior occurs as trade-wind energy flux surpasses approximately 1 × 105 W/m2 as indicated by EOF spatial and temporal components 1 and 3 (Figure 8a,b,e,f). The transition also coincides with south swell events beginning in early June and continuing through the beginning of October during which south swell energy flux exceeds 1 × 104 W/m2. While south swell events and associated volume and surface area gains continue until approximately late October to early November, the clear single cell western rotation appears to reverse with the passage of Hurricane Walaka, which produced large swell from the southwest, and relatively west of normal to the beach profile angle. This direction of wave approach represents the westernmost swell direction of the entire study period and likely explains why the direction of rotation reverses as indicated by an abrupt negative trend in the temporal coefficient of EOF mode 3. The unusual wave approach also explains erosional/accretional width change patterns at the far western/eastern extents of the beach, respectively following passage of the hurricane.\\n\\nFinally, topographic patterns of variability illustrated by EOF 3 do not clearly coincide with changes in volume and surface area but instead indicate initiation and reversals in single cell longshore transport behavior. This finding further reinforces the hypothesis that the mode mainly characterizes longshore sediment transport behavior owing to the presence of terminal structures at each end of the study area that block gains and/or losses that may otherwise occur as a result of movement of sediment between adjacent littoral cells.\\n\\n## 6. Conclusions\\n\\nResults from weekly survey data collected between April and November of 2018, combined with SfM and EOF analyses illustrate the efficacy of methods that employ low-cost, consumer-grade sUASs to conduct high-frequency coastal monitoring. Such methods are highly effective towards developing a detailed understanding of predominant drivers\\n---\\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5108\\n\\nthat influence coastal morphology. These findings are especially useful given the site-specific conditions that influence carbonate beaches due to the complex bathymetry of fringing reefs in environments that experience tropical storm systems and other seasonal and/or episodic phenomena.\\n\\nPrevious studies of Royal Hawaiian Beach [6,7,47], which employed data with coarser spatial and temporal resolution, concluded that the beach operated mainly as a single cell that featured seasonal reversals in transport direction. The unique contribution of this study is the higher spatial and temporal resolution of topographic data and prevalence of large-scale perturbations of the system (i.e., tropical cyclones), which has allowed a more thorough evaluation of natural drivers that influence transport patterns affecting erosion/accretion, beach morphology, and rip-current formation.\\n\\nSpecifically, the study revealed the presence of three dominant and highly unique transport patterns driven by mild trade-wind energy flux (EOF 1), large episodic perturbations in trade-wind energy flux and south-swell energy flux generated by episodic phenomena such as tropical cyclones (EOF 2), and reversals in larger-scale sediment transport patterns driven by variations in swell direction, south swell energy flux, and increases in trade-wind energy flux (EOF 3). We also showed that high spatial and temporal resolution monitoring of carbonate beaches, which are underrepresented in the global literature, can be performed in an affordable way and yield insights to their behavior that can inform management decisions. This is critical given their high economic value in the global tourism economy.\\n\\nThese data will assist managers, engineers, and other stakeholders in developing strategies to sustain Royal Hawaiian Beach. Considering the economic, ecological, recreational, and cultural value of carbonate beaches, we see these techniques as globally applicable. Given the likely continuation and acceleration of global mean sea level rise, many levels of stakeholders are invested in sustaining these high-value beaches for as long as possible. For these reasons, affordable, high-resolution systems, such as consumer-grade sUASs used in tandem with SfM and EOF analyses, prove to be a valuable tool for the management of coastal areas.\\n\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.K.M. and C.H.F.; Data curation, K.K.M.; Formal analysis, K.K.M., T.R.A. and S.H.; Investigation, K.K.M. and C.H.F.; Methodology, K.K.M.; Project administration, C.H.F.; Resources, C.H.F.; Software, K.K.M. and T.R.A.; Supervision, C.H.F.; Validation, K.K.M. and T.R.A.; Visualization, K.K.M.; Writing—original draft, K.K.M.; Writing—review and editing, K.K.M., C.H.F., T.R.A. and S.H.

Are these policies prepared to achieve lawfully stated objectives under accelerating sea level rise? To test the efficacy of these policies during the past century of slowly rising sea level, and thus their potential effectiveness under future accelerated sea level rise, we quantify land use on a section of windward O ahu coast, 1928–2015. Data show a shift from stable/accreting shorelines and wide beaches, to expanding erosion and beach loss concurrent with increasing development and seawall construction; trends at odds with policy objectives. Shoreline hardening increased 63%. Net shoreline change shifted from stable/accreting to erosional on 74% of the coast. More than 45% of this shift was due to flanking (erosion triggered by nearby hardening). Five geomorphic settings were analyzed. Prior to local coastal policy, from 1928 to 1975, headland beaches were mildly erosional with average change rates − 0.07 ± 0.1 m/yr. Beaches in all other geomorphic categories accreted. Between 1975 and 2015, following enactment of coastal zone management policy, average change in all geomorphologies shifted to erosional, coastal development and seawall construction expanded, average beach width declined. Today, nearly 20% of beach length has been lost; 55% of beaches have narrowed. Failure to achieve policy goals under slow, historic sea level rise (1.2 to 1.4 mm/yr) implies preserving beaches, open space, and public access will require new policies, or more effective ways for implementing existing policies, in a future characterized by accelerated sea level rise.\\n\\n### Significance\\n\\n1. Preserving and enhancing beaches, public access, and open space cannot be achieved in a time of rising sea level, if Coastal Zone Management (CMZ) policies allow development, and/or contain exemptions allowing shoreline hardening.\\n2. Using data-driven analysis of beach conservation in Hawai i, we find a failure to achieve program goals at all levels of the CZM network.\\n3. CZM policies designed by the State of Hawai‘i under the auspices of the National Coastal Zone Management Act and as implemented by state and county agencies, have proven inadequate to address issues of coastal erosion and thus leave local government ill-prepared to achieve their intended goals in a time characterized by sea level acceleration. This is likely also the case in other US states.\\n\\nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-018-2327-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\\n\\n* Charles H.

Long-term sea level rise (Church and White 2011), and accelerations (Nerem et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2017; Hay et al. 2015), exacerbate this situation.\\n\\nOn eroding coasts, owners will go to extraordinary lengths to protect their investment (Beatley 2009) such as building a seawall or revetment; as a result, 14% of the US tidal shoreline has been hardened (Gittman et al. 2015). This trend is not limited to the US. Studies from Japan (Koike 1996), the Caribbean (Rangel-Buitrago et al. 2015), parts of Europe (Manno et al. 2016), and China (Liu et al. 2018) document that shoreline hardening is a worldwide phenomenon.\\n\\nShoreline hardening disrupts natural processes, accelerates erosion on adjacent lands (known as “flanking”), and limits the natural dynamic behavior of the environment (Romine and Fletcher 2012a). Hardening on sandy beaches experiencing chronic erosion, ultimately the result of long-term sea level rise, causes beach narrowing and loss (Fletcher et al. 1997), and flanking triggers more hardening leading to additional beach degradation.\\n\\nDuring the last decade, numerous studies document how hardening directly and indirectly impacts a range of ecosystem functions, goods, and services (Dethier et al. 2017). In Hawai‘i, shoreline hardening has caused a total of 21.5 km of beach loss statewide (Fletcher et al. 2012), posing threats to the tourism economy, littoral ecology, federally protected species (e.g., Hawaiian monk seal [Neomonachus schauinslandi], and Hawaiian green sea turtle [Chelonia mydas]), local culture and (Romine & Fletcher, 2012b), and the general water safety preparation of Hawaiian children who first experience the Pacific Ocean on beaches.\\n\\nCoastal erosion is a major problem in Hawai i. Data in Fletcher et al. (2012) reveal that 70% of beaches on O ahu, Maui, and Kaua i experience an erosional trend. On O‘ahu’s 115 km coastline, historical seawall and revetment construction caused the narrowing of 17.3 km and total loss of 10.4 km of sandy beach over the period 1928 or 1949 to 1995. Combined, this is 24% of the original sandy shoreline (Fletcher et al. 1997).\\n\\nIn some parts of the world, shoreline hardening as a response to erosion reflects a coastal management model of action-reaction, compounded by the challenge of teasing out the natural causes of erosion (e.g., storms, seasonal waves, sea level rise) from those that are human-induced (e.g., disruptions to sand availability through hardening and dune removal) (Dethier et al. 2017). This is further exacerbated by multiple interests within a coastal management system that exert pressures upon local government officials who try to balance and accommodate competing interests (Nolon 2012). In other parts of the world, coastal management policies are implemented as statutory or as guidance documents (Williams et al. 2018). In the USA, coastal policy is a voluntary partnership between federal government, coastal states, and local jurisdictions. Individual programs vary by state, each under the auspices of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), but all must fulfill goals of protecting shorelines.\\n\\nAs development increases, and global sea level rise continues to accelerate (Nerem et al. 2018), it is essential to ensure that management policies are effective at preserving and protecting coastal environments including sandy beaches. Studies that evaluate coastal zone management have most typically focused on policies, plans, and organizational issues (Lowry Jr 1980; Hershman et al. 1999). Bernd-Cohen and Gordon (1999) studied US states’ program effectiveness in meeting the goals of shoreline preservation and found programs are generally meeting CZMA objectives. However, this conclusion was based on program indicators and not beach protection outcomes.\\n---\\n## Climatic Change (2018) 151:427–443\\n\\ndue to limited on-the-ground documentation. A detailed analysis by Good (1994) evaluated the outcomes of shore protection policies within one area of the central Oregon coast, finding policies to protect the beach were ineffective. More recently, Windrope et al. (2016) performed a 35-year evaluation of outcomes of the WA Shoreline Management Act (1977) and find little change in shore hardening despite increased regulation post 1977.\\n\\nHere we document the efficacy of coastal zone policy in Hawai i over the past century to protect the shoreline, a time characterized by relatively low rates of sea level rise (SLR). During the past century, the historic SLR trend for O ahu (1 to 2 mm/yr) is similar to that of the island of Kaua i but different from Maui (2 to 3 mm/yr) (Romine et al. 2013). In Hawai i, coastal erosion is linked to SLR. However, the relative influence of SLR on shoreline change is understood to be presently minor compared with other driving factors, although this is expected to change with future SLR (Anderson et al. 2015). Coastal erosion is the result of several physical drivers including impacts to sediment supply, wave conditions, sediment transport processes, human derived structures, and geomorphology (Romine et al. 2013).\\n\\nWe use a detailed, data-driven investigation of historical shoreline change and land use patterns on a representative segment of the Hawaiian shoreline to support our analysis of coastal management. Our approach is similar to Manno et al. (2016) and Winthrope et al. (2016) in that we document historical shoreline change to assess the effectiveness of coastal management but we go one step further by linking shoreline erosion to coastal development patterns and hardening.\\n\\n## Coastal zone management policy\\n\\nRecognizing rapid growth and the need for better coastal zone management, the US Congress enacted the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in 1972 (Chasis 1985). The purpose of the CZMA is to “preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance the resources of the nation’s coastal zone” (16 USC §§ 1451-1466). The CZMA encourages states to create coastal management plans and policies by involving local jurisdictions and communities in the planning and regulatory enterprise, thereby fostering cooperation among federal, state, and local governments (Nolon 2012).\\n\\nThe Hawai i Coastal Zone Management Program (HCZMP) is a typical federal-local partnership under the National CZM Program. Established in 1977 to “provide for the effective management, beneficial use, protection, and development of the coastal zone” (HRS §§ 205A-1 to 49), the HCZMP is a networked system, regulating the coastal zone through the state and local agencies. In fiscal year 2016, for instance, Hawai i allocation for coastal zone management from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office for Coastal Management (NOAA-OCM) totaling $2,269,049 was distributed among local network agencies in support of coastal management activities aligned with federal and state program goals.\\n\\nCoastal development in Hawai i is regulated through three main policies: 1) Local zoning ordinances that establish approved uses, densities and height limits, 2) Special Management Areas (SMA), and 3) Shoreline Setbacks (Braxton 2003). The SMA designates areas along the shoreline that require special controls on development, while the setback establishes a development prohibition zone defined by a minimum distance from a designated baseline (defined in Hawai i as the highest annual reach of the waves; HRS §§ 205A).\\n\\nOn the capital island of O ahu, the county has adopted an SMA in the local ordinance that mirrors the HCZMP: “to preserve, protect, and where possible, to restore the natural resources of the coastal zone of Hawai i” (ROH § 25-1.2). However, there are a number of exemptions\\n---\\n## Methods, study area\\n\\nOur methods follow several earlier publications (Fletcher et al. 2003, 2012; Romine et al. 2009) and are described in Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM). We build geographic information system datasets from a sequence of orthorectified vertical aerial photomosaics across the time period 1928 to 2015. We quantify the history of beach erosion and accretion, coastal hardening, coastal development, flanking, and physical wave and weather events. Our data are binned in terms of the coastal geomorphology, and as time period averages.\\n\\nThe study area is 7.42 km of reef-fronted shoreline (Conger et al. 2009) on the northeast coast of Oahu. Like most beaches in Hawaii, the sand supply is derived from carbonate sources on nearby reefs and erosion of backshore sand-rich dune systems. Beaches are also exposed to waves year-round (Vitousek & Fletcher, 2008) from varying directions, which serves as the principal driver of sediment transport. Over the period of our analysis, sea level has been rising in the study area, 1.2–1.4 mm/yr (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). In 1928, the coast consisted of a single continuous\\n\\n| | |150|135|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|45| |Oahu|Study area|\\n|30| |Mokuoloe|tide station|\\n| |Pacific Ocean| | |\\n|22| |0|10km|\\n| |Hawaii| | |\\n|20| |Honolulu tide station| |\\n| |Trade winds| | |\\n\\nFig. 1 The study area extends from Hauula to Makalii Point, northeast Oahu\\n---\\n## Climatic Change (2018) 151:427–443\\n\\nsandy beach (10- to 30-m wide) composed of late to middle Holocene carbonate sand (Harney et al. 2000), originating from the adjacent fringing reef (Harney and Fletcher 2003).\\n\\nFollowing the morphology of the reef, the coastline is characterized by recurrent headland and embayed segments with shorelines that behave in distinct ways (Romine et al. 2016).\\n\\nThus, we identify patterns of shoreline change and development associated with the following beach morphologies: (1) headland beaches, (2) embayed beaches, (3) transitional beaches between headlands and embayments, (4) shallow reef-fronted beaches, and (5) beaches fronted by sand fields and sand-filled channels.\\n\\nThe area is extensively developed with a coastal highway, homes, and widespread shoreline hardening. The Kamehameha Highway is the main road in the region and is heavily traveled. It was built parallel to the shoreline and acts as a barrier that impedes access to the ocean and pins coastal development on relatively shallow shorefront lots.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nAnalysis of a sequence of aerial photos 1928 to 2015 defines trends in land use and shoreline change (Fig. 2). Four attributes were specifically identified: coastal geomorphology, shoreline change, coastal development, and coastal hardening.\\n\\nOver the time period, averages of shoreline change rates indicate a region-wide switch from stable or accreting beaches to generally eroding, or experiencing reductions in accretion, for all geomorphologies, except headland beaches. Data from headland beaches indicates chronic erosion from the beginning of the study period, which accelerated over the time period.\\n\\nThe average shoreline change rate for the entire coastline reflects a switch from stable/accreting to erosional. However, the divergence between the distinctly erosional headland beaches and the accretional embayed and transitional beaches early in the time series create large uncertainty in the combined averages of the early data.\\n\\n|Shoreline Change Rate (m) from 1928 to listed year|Alongshore Distance (km)|\\n|---|---|\\n|1.2|1967|\\n|0.8|1971|\\n|0.4|1975|\\n|Erosion|1988|\\n|-0.4|2000|\\n|-0.8|2006|\\n| |2015|\\n\\nGeomorphic boundaries for headland/embayed/transitional beaches: Hau‘ula, Punalu‘u, Makali‘i\\n\\nGeomorphic boundaries for beaches fronted by reef/sand-channel: shallow reef-fronted, fronted by sand fields and sand-filled channels\\n\\nFig. 2 Rates of shoreline change from 1928 to each successive year were calculated from digitized shoreline positions at transects spaced 20 m along the length of the study area. Data recording historical shoreline behavior were collected from 5 overlapping geomorphic regions: (1) headland beaches, (2) embayed beaches, (3) transitional beaches between headlands and embayments, (4) shallow reef-fronted beaches, and (5) beaches fronted by sand fields and sand-filled channels\\n---\\n## Fig. 3\\n\\nOver the period of study, the region changed from a generally stable/accreting coast (with the exception of headland beaches) to a coast characterized by chronic erosion.

By 2006, on average, all five morphologies were experiencing chronic erosion. Data document a sandy shoreline that was generally stable or accreting throughout the early and middle twentieth century (with the exception of headland beaches), undergoing a shift to chronically eroding in the present day.\\n\\nFrom 1928 to 2015, headland beaches showed significant erosion with an average rate of -0.11 ± 0.06 m per year, while transition and embayed beaches experienced milder erosion with rates of -0.02 ± 0.05 m per year, and -0.01 ± 0.04 m per year, respectively. Shallow reef-fronted beaches, and beaches fronted by sand fields and sand-filled channels eroded from 1928 to 2015 at a rate of -0.06 ± 0.05 m per year and -0.04 ± 0.04 m per year, respectively.\\n\\nOver the study period, the percentage of erosion and the percentage of beach lost to erosion increased (Table SI5). Nineteen percent of the total length of sandy beach was permanently lost to erosion, and 55% narrowed. A total of 74% of the beach was degraded (lost + narrowed) at an average rate of -0.06 ± 0.05 m per year.\\n\\nThe length of shoreline hardening increased steadily throughout the entire time series rising from a complete absence of seawalls in 1928 to nearly 5 km of hardened shoreline today (Fig. 4).\\n\\nThe use of seawalls and the rise of buildings on beachfront lots are strongly correlated (r-0.97). Records show that in 1928, thirty-nine buildings existed along the shoreline without the need for shoreline hardening (Table SI6). However, the number of buildings along the shoreline increased by more than fourfold, from 39 to 177 between 1928 and 1975 and the length of hardened shoreline increased to 45%.\\n---\\n| |Hardening|Length of seawall (km)|% of shoreline hardened|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Length of seawall (km)|0|1928|100|\\n| |2|1949|80|\\n| |4|1958|60|\\n| |6|1967|40|\\n| | |1971|20|\\n| |% of shoreline hardened|1975|0|\\n|200|Buildings|# of coastal buildings| |\\n|# of coastal buildings|0|1928|100|\\n| |40|1949|80|\\n| |80|1958|60|\\n| |120|1967|40|\\n| | |1971|20|\\n| |% of TMK parcels developed|1975|0|\\n\\nFig. 4 Top: length of hardened coast (black, km), and percentage of hardened coast (red). Bottom: number of beachfront buildings (black), and percentage of beachfront parcels developed (red)\\n\\nBy 1975, 3.34 km of the shoreline had been hardened. The most recent data for year 2015 shows a total of 189 established coastal buildings fronted by 63% of the shoreline.\\n\\nThe history of beach width is also related to coastal morphology, with embayed and transitional beaches generally having the greatest width, and headland beaches the least (Fig. 5). Over the period of study, beach width for all morphologies displayed significant variability.\\n\\nOn average, headland beaches (combined hardened and unhardened) narrowed by approximately 50% over the period while embayed and transition beaches (combined hardened and unhardened) showed no net trend. The average beach width on hardened shorelines (8.6 m) showed no net trend over the time series but is approximately 42% the width of beaches on unhardened shorelines (14.8 m).\\n\\nData was also analyzed to compare the average rate of erosion during the years prior to the adoption of the US and local CZM programs (1928 to 1975) and the years following (1975 to 2015) (Fig. 6).\\n\\nThe data indicate that from 1928 to 1975, embayed and transition beaches accreted (0.11 ± 0.08 and 0.11 ± 0.03 m per year, resp.). However, on headland beaches, the shoreline eroded at an average rate of − 0.07 ± 0.1 m per year. In comparison, following the adoption of CZM policy (1975 to 2015), the shoreline eroded on headland, transition, and embayment beaches at an average rate of − 0.09 ± 0.09 m per year, − 0.18 ± 0.06 m per year, and − 0.18 ± 0.09 m per year, respectively.\\n\\nFrom 1928 to 1975, beaches fronted by sand fields and sand-filled channels and shallow reef-fronted beaches accreted 0.02 ± 0.07 m per year and 0.04 ± 0.05 m per year (resp.) (Table SI7). From 1975 to 2015, shorelines became erosive for both types. Shallow reef-fronted beaches experienced erosion of − 0.13 ± 0.05 m per year and beaches fronted by sand fields and sand-filled channels eroded − 0.17 ± 0.07 m per year. Prior to creation of the CZM regime, 0.8% of beaches had been permanently lost. Since creation of CZM policy, 19% of beaches have been lost.\\n---\\n| |1928-1975|1975-2015|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Erosion|80%| |\\n|Accretion| |20%|\\n|Beach loss| | |\\n---\\n## Hardening\\n\\nConcurrent to the growth in development, coastal hardening increased by 63%, comprising 4.67 km of seawalls and revetments. None of the shoreline was armored in 1928. As development in the study area boomed throughout the 1940’s, so did the hardening of coastal lots. Prior to the adoption of the HCZMP in 1975, 45% was armored. From 1975 to 2015, hardening increased by 18%.\\n\\nAn extensive amount of hardening occurred first in headland regions. By 1975, 63% of headland regions were armored, while 42% of transition regions and 22% of embayed regions were armored. Headland regions were subject to coastal hardening before transition and embayed regions for two reasons: (1) the majority of coastal development was concentrated in headland areas, and (2) the geomorphology of headlands and embayments influences sediment transport and deposition. Waves refract at headlands such that their energy is focused on the shoreline. As a result, headlands experience accelerated erosion while embayments tend to be more stable and may even act as depositional locations for sand eroded from an adjacent headland (Romine et al. 2016).\\n\\nAfter the 1980s, coastal hardening dramatically increased in transition regions. By 2015, 77% of headland regions and 78% of transition regions were hardened. The increase in the length of seawalls despite the reduced rate of new development after 1975 could be attributed to other variables including the process of “flanking,” sea level rise, and an increase in extreme swell events, which may accelerate coastal erosion rates.\\n\\nA similar trend was observed along 3.14 km of shoreline directly adjacent to the coastal highway. Data show that 46% of the coastal highway was armored by 2015. Although 52% of the coastal highway travels through embayment coasts, areas where the highway ran closer to the ocean in headland regions were armored first.\\n\\nBy 1975, 31% of the coastal highway was fronted by hardening and more than half (53%) of the hardening occurred in headland coasts. However, after the 1980’s, coastal hardening to protect the highway had spread to transition regions. By 2015, 46% of the coastal highway was fronted by hardening and of that percentage, 20% occurred in headland and transitional coasts.\\n\\n## Beach loss\\n\\nErosion in the study area increased from 57% in 1967 to 74% in 2015. Prior to 1967, there had been no beach loss aside from localized seasonal loss on 10% of the coast. Seasonal beach loss, followed by recovery, typically occurs with changes in the seasonal wave climate and may be a signal that a beach is severely sand-depleted.\\n\\nBy 2015, 19% of the beach had been permanently lost to erosion (Fig. 7). Beach loss intensified in headland regions compared to embayed regions. Shoreline change rates in headland regions show a steady erosional trend both pre- (1928 to 1975) and post- (1975 to 2015) coastal zone policy. In transition and embayment regions, rates changed significantly\\n---\\n## Fig. 7\\n\\n| |1967|1971|1975|1988|2006|2015|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|% Erosion| | | | | | |\\n|Percent|57| | | | |74|\\n|% Beach Permanently Lost| | | | | |19|\\n\\nErosion in the study area increased from 57% in 1967 to 74% in 2015. By 2015, 19% of the beach had been permanently lost to erosion from accretion to erosion (Table SI7). Beach loss violates CZM goals of 1) Protecting beaches for public use and recreation, 2) Protecting, preserving, and restoring coastal scenic and open space resources, 3) Protecting valuable coastal ecosystems, 4) Reducing exposure to coastal hazards, and most of the other objectives and policies set forth in Hawai‘i coastal law (HRS205-A).\\n\\n## Land use\\n\\nBetween 1928 and 1975, the number of buildings in the study area increased from 39 to 177, an annual growth rate of 3.20%. Between 1975 and 2015, the annual growth in new buildings fell to 0.16%. By 1975, for every empty lot, there were seven developed lots. Thus, the slowed rate of individual building construction after 1975 reflects a coastal zone that was largely built out prior to enactment of state and county coastal zone policies.\\n\\nSince 1975, redevelopment of existing buildings into structures with larger footprints has increased overall density. Expansion of existing single-family homes is allowed under SMA policy (ROH § 25-1.3.2A) and this constitutes a de facto increase in coastal development that continues to present day. Rapid build-out prior to coastal policy, followed by subsequent expansion of these buildings under policy authority, sets the stage for widespread seawall construction against a background of sea level rise.\\n\\nWe calculated average building surface area from digitized coastal buildings shapefiles created in ArcGIS. The average building surface area in the 1970’s was 170 square meters whereas the average building surface area in 2015 was 203 square meters, an increase of 20%.\\n\\nPhotogrammetric analysis reveals that throughout the 1970’s many existing structures along the coastline were either demolished and replaced by larger structures, or they were expanded. The increase in building size combined with the location of the coastal highway directly behind these structures prevented the relocation of threatened buildings in the face of chronic erosion.\\n\\nCZM policies appear to have done little to prevent a 29% increase in coastal hardening that occurred between 1975 and 2006. Data shows this spike in hardening followed the build-out of 78% of shoreline lots by 1975, and was concurrent with the expansion in average building area that occurred between the 1970’s and 2015.\\n---\\n## Flanking\\n\\nThe shift from a stable beach to an eroding beach may often be attributed to flanking (Romine and Fletcher 2012a) resulting from a long-term pattern of shoreline hardening (Fig. 8) that still continues today.\\n\\nWe tested this phenomenon by calculating shoreline change rates directly north and south of armored locations before and after installation. Data reveal that erosion rates on more than 27% of the study area significantly accelerated due to flanking. In many cases, rates shifted from an accreting trend to an erosional trend following hardening on the adjacent shore. To illustrate, directly adjacent to hardening installed in the 1960’s, shorelines became unstable, shifting from an average 0.3 ± 0.06 m per year (accreting) prior to the installation of hardening to - 0.4 ± 0.08 m per year (eroding) after the installation of hardening.\\n\\nCoastal property owners adjacent to seawalls will often harden their own properties in response to flanking. Shoreline history confirms the existence of a “hardening domino effect” in which the first seawall triggers a succession of seawalls by adjacent property owners (Romine and Fletcher 2012a). The domino effect of coastal hardening has been documented in other regions, for example, Manno et al. (2016) traced the decadal evolution of hardening along a portion of the Mediterranean coast and demonstrated protection structures produce a deficiency in sediment while shifting downdrift erosion processes, which are then countered by additional structures.\\n\\nIn our study, by 2015, roughly 45% of the observed hardening was constructed in response to an adjacent seawall or revetment. Contributing to this pattern was the continued construction of beachfront buildings, initially on stable shorelines, but which became vulnerable to erosion due to flanking. Our data reveal that construction of first seawalls along a coastal reach destabilizes adjacent shorelines and promotes subsequent coastal hardening that can sentence an entire region of sandy beach to narrowing and eventual loss.\\n\\n## Failure to achieve CZM goals\\n\\nHawaii’s coastal land use management system is complex, but three main laws govern its uses: county zoning ordinances, shoreline setbacks enacted in 1970 that established a minimum 40′ setback from the shoreline, and the Hawai‘i Coastal Zone Management Program. There are 10 objectives in the authorizing statute for the HCZMP (HRS §§ 205A), summarized here as protecting and improving natural resources and ecosystems, reducing exposure to hazards, providing for public participation, and affording economic activity in suitable locations. Objective 9 is simply “Beach Protection - Protect beaches for public use and recreation.”\\n\\nThe “Punaluu Beach Homes Shoreline Protection Project” is a 643-ft-long continuous concrete rubble revetment along seven residential lots. A permit application for this project has been evaluated under the authority of CZM policy. The applicant states that “coastal erosion has persisted along this coast for the previous three decades” and concludes that hardening this chronically eroding shoreline will “promote sand accretion.” This application has made its way through the HCZMP network, has not been challenged for the deceptive nature of its conclusions, and is currently under construction.\\n\\nMaui and Kaua i counties adopted erosion rate-based setbacks using a combination of criteria: the rate of historical shoreline change, or the average depth of the lot. On Maui, the setback is calculated as either 50 times the annual rate of erosion plus 25 ft or is based on the average lot depth, whichever gives a greater distance from the shoreline. On Kaua i, the setback is a distance equal to 40 ft plus 70 times the annual coastal erosion rate (for buildings 5000 sq. feet or less) or 40 ft plus 100 times the annual coastal erosion rate (buildings greater than 5000 sq. feet).\\n---\\n## Flanking: Area of accelerated erosion\\n\\n|Seawall|Flanking|1967 Shoreline Armoring|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Erosion|Cross shore component of scour|Longshore component of scour|\\n\\nFig. 8 Left: coastlines adjacent to a seawall or revetment are typically subjected to increased erosion as a result of reductions in sand availability by the presence of the hardened shoreline. This effect, known as “flanking,” encourages land owners to harden their own shore in order to protect their newly eroding lands. This, in turn, leads to more flanking and beach loss. Dotted line: future shoreline position. Right: flanking in Makali i as a result of coastal hardening built in the 1960’s\\n\\nEach objective is further expanded with an accompanying policy. Policy 9—Beach Protection, has three elements: (1) locating new structures inland, (2) prohibiting private erosion-protection structures, and (3) minimizing public erosion protection structures.\\n\\nThe HCZMP mandates the establishment of an SMA extending inland “no less than 100 yards from the shoreline.” Responsibility for implementing the law rests with county government. Each county established procedures for identifying SMA boundaries and adopted their own permit guidelines (consistent with state law) for new buildings [or substantial renovations] within the SMA.\\n\\nA challenge to implementing the SMA is county zoning. Land use zoning creates “entitlements” or expectations about how private land owners can use their land. Courts have generally deferred to landowner claims that denial of building permits consistent with underlying zoning would constitute an unconstitutional “taking” of private property. Hence, while the SMA permit provides counties the legal authority to deny permits for building inconsistent with SMA guidelines, few permits are denied for land units. In practice, the SMA permit has been used primarily to impose permit conditions, such as modifications in building site plans to ensure increased shoreline setbacks, requirements for additional public access, and changes in landscaping plans to reduce runoff and similar requirements.\\n\\nThe data-based history of shoreline change rates reported here shows that beaches in the study area experienced either a transition from accretion to erosion, or from light erosion to strong erosion. Shoreline change was observed when comparing rates from 1928–1975 (pre-HCZMP period) to 1975–2015 (enforced HCZMP period) for beaches in all geomorphic settings.\\n\\nOver the period of our study, the influence of increased coastal development in the study area is evident; continued building and highway construction is eventually threatened by chronic erosion, triggering hardening, beach narrowing, and loss. In addition, widespread shoreline hardening activated the process of flanking, contributing to the shift from stable/accreting to erosional beaches.\\n\\nThis detailed history of shoreline change reveals human-induced factors that likely drove important aspects of the recent erosion trend, a trend that could be partially to blame for O‘ahu losing at least 24% of its sandy beaches to hardening, and possibly more (Fletcher et al. 1997). Other factors that could be driving the erosional trend besides coastal construction, expansion, and hardening include sediment transport processes and SLR. Romine et al. (2013) studied shoreline change across the Hawaiian Islands and found a wide variation in erosion rates across different segments of island shoreline despite a rather homogeneous SLR for the island. This suggests that human impacts and persistent physical transport mechanisms may have a larger influence on historical shoreline change than SLR.\\n---\\nIn spite of substantial legal authority to address shoreline erosion, appointed and elected land use officials have frequently:\\n\\n1. Approved hardship variances allowing seawall construction,\\n2. Permitted expansion of single family homes within the SMA,\\n3. Approved building on coastal lots without regard to shoreline stability, and\\n4. Allowed maintenance and expansion of non-conforming buildings.\\n\\nThese practices have been repeatedly approved over decades since the enactment and enforcement of HCZMP with consequences that fail to meet the goals of the program.\\n\\nConsequently, our data reveals that despite strategies to mitigate the negative effects of shoreline development and hardening on the beach, the establishment of Hawai\\'i coastal zone management policies did not adequately protect beaches in the study area, public access along the shoreline, nor open space in a meaningful way.\\n\\nLike other states, local governments in Hawai\\'i are the primary implementers of coastal policies through land use powers and infrastructure improvements (Nolon 2012). Several previous studies show that state mandates for coastal management do not guarantee effective policy implementation at the local level (Blizzard and Mangun 2008; Windrope et al. 2016).\\n\\nThere are several reasons why local officials and land use managers might not be using the full weight of HCZM laws. Local governments avoid \"taking\" claims by either imposing permit conditions on applicants or by issuing variances all together for new development or building expansions.\\n\\nIn Florida, Ruppert (2008) suggests strengthening the state setback law by stipulating that variances only be granted on the condition that a deed restriction is recorded which disallows seawalls and requires the removal of structures at owner\\'s expense if they impact the beach. Local governments can also issue temporary emergency hardening permits. Oftentimes, these emergency provisions, which were meant as temporary, become permanent (Cheong 2011; Ruppert 2008).\\n\\nAnother potential explanation is that local political actors exert significant pressure on officials to obtain permits or to shape local policies all together (Feiock 2004). Coastal properties in Hawai\\'i hold tremendous value and their owners may translate that wealth into political clout that can be used to obtain a permit (Ruppert 2008). Another complication is disentangling the causal mechanisms of beach loss. Local regulators have had little data to base efforts to strengthen or enforce regulations for restricting structures (Dethier et al. 2017). More longitudinal and place-based studies such as this one are needed to help assess the success or failure of coastal policies and their implementation.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nToday, Hawai\\'i and the rest of the USA is entering a future characterized by accelerating sea level rise (Sweet et al. 2017; Nerem et al. 2018) and increasing storminess (Murakami et al. 2013). Improving sustainability, resilience, and environmental conservation in the face of these challenges is the obligation of elected officials, policy-makers, and agency professionals.\\n\\nCoastal land use policies establish a Special Management Area (SMA) and a construction prohibition zone (the setback) with the stated objectives of protecting and enhancing the natural\\n---\\n## 440 Climatic Change (2018) 151:427–443\\n\\nCharacter of the shoreline, public pedestrian access, and open space. We test the success of these policies with a detailed history of shoreline change and coastal development on the coast of Oahu over the span 1928 to 2015, a period characterized by long-term, though slow, sea level rise.\\n\\nWe find a clear failure to achieve policy objectives for six primary reasons:\\n\\n|1.|The implementation of a fixed distance setback law allowed building and road construction without regard to coastal erosion patterns, thus ensuring that at least some development will be threatened by erosion before its planned lifetime;|\\n|---|---|\\n|2.|The application of SMA rules has allowed expansion of building footprints associated with single-family homes; this ensures that most buildings will have no effective lifetime as they may be continuously renovated, even expanded, further locking in eventual threats by erosion;|\\n|3.|The setback law contains a loophole called a “hardship variance” allowing all forms of development to be protected by coastal hardening, ensuring the demise of beaches experiencing chronic erosion (a physical certainty in a regime of long-term sea level rise).|\\n|4.|This sequence of permissive development, hardening, and beach loss is further promoted by the flanking process, whereby a hardened shoreline triggers and accelerates erosion on an adjacent beach.|\\n|5.|The shoreline is managed parcel by parcel. This promotes short-sighted decision-making without awareness of accumulated impacts, long-term trends, or place-based characteristics.|\\n|6.|Agency personnel with authority to decide on applications for coastal zone uses are not required to, and traditionally have not had, scientific training in the interpretation of potential impacts. In lieu of this, decisions are made on the basis of statements from consultants hired by the applicant - a situation that is ripe for conflict of interest.|\\n\\nWe find that headland beaches were more threatened by erosion than embayed beaches, which led to the majority of seawall construction in these regions. This, in turn, led to accelerated erosion by flanking and a greater percentage of permanent beach loss in headland regions. Embayed and transition beaches, which were accreting prior to CZM policies, experienced accelerated erosion after policies were established. Consequently, the increase in erosion resulted in a spike in the construction of seawalls and revetments despite lawfully enacted objectives against this.\\n\\nWe call attention to the need for substantial revision of coastal zone management in order to protect beaches. Beaches continue to narrow and seawalls and revetments continue to be permitted to protect development sites where the rate of erosion has exceeded the protection afforded by the setback over the lifetime of the building.\\n\\nToday the world is entering a long and uncertain period characterized by accelerated sea level rise. If Hawaii, the USA, and the world aim to prevent a complete loss of its beaches and associated public access and open viewplanes, it will require a review and revision of the coastal policies and their implementation that have failed to meet lawfully codified objectives.\\n\\nFunding information: This study was supported by grants from the H.K.L.

Several recent studies find that current and projected SLR is associated with relatively lower property values. We contribute to this growing body of research with a case study of O‘ahu, Hawai‘i, which is famed for its beaches as well as valuable coastal real estate. We leverage a dataset that unpacks multiple types of SLR exposure and coastal parcel attributes. We apply property transaction data for the island of O‘ahu through 2019 to investigate the effect of current and expected SLR exposure on residential property prices. We find that exposed properties have already experienced declines in transaction prices, at 9 to 14%, attributed to expectations of exposure to chronic inundation (as opposed to seasonal flooding). The price declines are mainly for multi-dwelling homes as opposed to single family homes. The market response of residential properties to SLR has important implications for coastal management strategies, in particular the viability and timing of programs for retreat.\\n\\n### Keywords\\n\\nSea level rise · Hedonic model · Coastal management · Climate change adaptation\\n\\n* Nori Tarui\\n\\nnori@hawaii.edu\\n\\n1 University of Hawaiʻi Economic Research Organization (UHERO), University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, Honolulu, HI, USA\\n\\n2 Department of Economics, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, Honolulu, HI, USA\\n\\n3 Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Salem, MA, USA\\n\\n4 Shidler College of Business, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, Honolulu, HI, USA\\n\\n5 Institute for Sustainability and Resilience, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, Honolulu, HI, USA\\n\\n6 Department of Urban and Regional Planning, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, Honolulu, HI, USA\\n---\\n## Page 2 of 21\\n\\nClimatic Change (2023) 176:130\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nClimate change-induced sea level rise (SLR) will dramatically affect coastal communities and ecosystems across the world (IPCC 2021). The IPCC (2021) predicts a range of expected mean SLR by 2100 under a set of shared socio-economic pathways, ranging from 0.28 to 0.55 m under very low emissions scenarios to 0.63–1.01 m under business-as-usual emissions, with even higher values possible due to uncertainties in ice-sheet dynamics. An early and growing body of literature has explored how real estate markets are responding to climate change in the US context (Bakkensen and Barrage 2017; Bunten and Kahn 2014; Gibson and Mullins 2020; Hino and Burke 2021; Keenan et al. 2018; Walsh et al. 2019).\\n\\nSeveral studies investigate whether and the extent to which coastal properties are losing value as a result of current and expected SLR (Bernstein et al. 2019; Baldauf et al. 2020; Murfin and Spiegel 2020; Tyndall 2021). Bernstein et al. (2019) is the most spatially comprehensive US study to date. It uses residential real estate transactions data between 2007 and 2019 and found an average 7% decline in coastal properties that will be exposed to 6 ft. of SLR (as defined by NOAA, Marcy et al. 2011). Several US regional case studies illustrate variation in local market response (Catma 2021; McAlpine and Porter 2018; Tyndall 2021; Walsh et al. 2019) and therefore the importance of understanding place-based housing market dynamics for the purposes of informing local climate adaptation policy.\\n\\nOur hedonic study — comparing properties of the same type and attributes in the same neighborhood with similar distance from the coastline and elevation — contributes to this growing body of literature by adding a case study of O‘ahu, Hawai‘i. We use available housing transaction data going back to 1994, and find that SLR impacts are becoming increasingly salient within O‘ahu’s housing market. Using a near-term time period, from 2014 to 2019, when SLR impacts would be more widely understood, we find that residential properties identified within a 1-m SLR exposure risk area were associated with a 9 to 14% transaction price discount. We find that the measured SLR discount is driven by impacts to multi-dwelling residences.\\n\\n### Prior work on SLR, flooding, and real estate values\\n\\nBernstein et al. (2019) national study found that the 7% decline in average home values exposed to SLR was driven almost entirely by non-owner occupied homes. Murfin and Spiegel (2020), in a study of single-family homes and duplexes, on the other hand, found no effect on housing price from SLR exposure. Tyndall (2021) found a relative year-to-year property price decline of 1.4% using real estate transactions from 2000 to 2017 for Long Island. Early studies suggest that there is likely to be considerable regional variation in how SLR affects real estate markets across the USA.\\n\\nNumerous empirical analyses focus on Florida because of its particular vulnerability to SLR (Keenan et al. 2018; McAlpine and Porter 2018; Conyers et al. 2019; Keys and Mulder 2020). Keys and Mulder (2020) found that housing in SLR-exposed communities across the state experienced a 5% discount between 2018 and 2020, with no price effect in the 5 years previous, even as sales volume declined 16–20% from 2013 to 2018. Conyers et al. (2019), using a SLR vulnerability measure based on levels of exposure and readiness, found SLR was not priced into the local Miami-Dade County housing market, arguing that real estate professionals failed to disclose the predicted effects.\\n---\\n## Page 3 of 21\\n\\nof SLR. A survey of realtors in the city found a majority of buyers did not ask about climate change when purchasing property (Bendixen and Amandi International 2017). Keenan et al. (2018) found that higher elevation properties within flood prone areas experienced higher rates of appreciation, indicating Miami has also been experiencing “climate gentrification.” Between 2005 and 2016, the Miami-Dade real estate market was estimated to have lost $465 million from SLR-affected inundation risk (McAlpine and Porter 2018). Expanding their hedonic work to other locations in a First Street Foundation (2019) report, McAlpine and Porter found a $15.9 billion loss in SLR-exposed home values across the 18 coastal states along the East Coast and Gulf Coast, with Florida and New Jersey having the greatest loss at $5.4 B and $4.5 B, respectively. Their methodology was used in the creation of the First Street Foundation Flood Model underlying Flood Factor (First Street Foundation 2019), a communicator of proper flood risk for homeowners in the continental USA.\\n\\nInformation and individual beliefs surrounding flood and SLR exposure play a role in determining whether inundation risk is properly incorporated into housing prices (Bakkensen and Barrage 2017; Baldauf et al. 2020; Gibson and Mullins 2020; Hino and Burke 2021). Hino and Burke (2021) examined the national market of flood zone housing and found a $43.8 billion overvaluation based on publicly available flood hazard maps. Even if flood risk information is available, beliefs about climate change may preclude some homeowners from internalizing risk (Bakkensen and Barrage 2017). A survey by Palm and Bolsen (2020) found that while South Florida residents in flood-prone areas did, in general, believe that climate change is occurring and anthropogenic, they did not believe their homes were at risk or that their property values were vulnerable to SLR. Furthermore, the study found that individual’s exposure within flood maps may reduce belief in climate change and belief that SLR threatens their property’s value. Owner-occupied properties have been found to be discounted in line with local concerns about SLR, while sophisticated investors tend to account for SLR risk regardless of beliefs (Bernstein et al. 2019; Giglio et al. 2021). Heterogeneity in climate change and SLR risk beliefs has been found to correlate with believers often selling to non-believers (Bunten and Kahn 2014; Bakkensen and Barrage 2017).\\n\\nAlong with typical explanatory variables for housing prices, like property size and the number of bedrooms that are contained in all hedonic models, additional variables are important to capturing characteristics of coastal properties in particular. Waterfront properties, and those with proximity to the beach or the coastline, have been found to command a premium (Bin et al. 2008, 2011; Krause 2014; Jin et al. 2015; Dumm et al. 2016; Walsh et al. 2019). Jin et al. (2015) compiled 17 studies in this area, with all but one finding a significant negative relationship between home price and increasing distance from the water or beach. Dumm et al. (2016) found waterfront properties had a 7% premium in Tampa Bay, Florida, during the 2000 to 2012 time period. On the other hand, houses in recently flooded areas are found to experience a discount, even if short-lived (Bin and Landry 2012; Atreya et al. 2013). In addition, coastal homes experiencing flooding may resort to armoring with seawalls or other structures, which have been found to have mixed effects on waterfront property values. Walsh et al. (2019) found a positive interaction for 0–2 ft SLR zone properties with bulkheads in Chesapeake Bay, while Brucal and Lynham (2020) found no strong evidence that seawalls were positively related to protected home values in a study of Santa Cruz and San Diego counties. Lastly, SLR can interact with other types of coastal risks to exacerbate hazards, including the presence of on-site disposal systems (OSDS, i.e., cesspools and septics) (Habel et al. 2017; Mezzacapo et al. 2020).\\n---\\n## Page 4 of 21 Climatic Change (2023) 176:130\\n\\nBrief context of shoreline considerations for O‘ahu, Hawai‘i\\n\\nThe Hawaiian Islands naturally erode into the Pacific Ocean, but the phenomenon is accelerated by SLR and shoreline infrastructure. Over 29% of O‘ahu’s sandy shoreline is already hardened, with 61% eroding as of 2020 (Tavares et al. 2020). The proportion of eroding beaches is projected to increase to 80% and 89% with 0.25 m and 0.74 m of SLR, respectively (Tavares et al. 2020).\\n\\nThe shoreline in Hawai‘i, legally classified as a public trust resource in the State constitution, is marked by the high wash of seasonal waves. This definition came about through a series of Hawai‘i Supreme Court decisions, which cited Native Hawaiian tradition and customs (Sproat 2009; Vance and Wallsgrove 2006). Beaches in Hawai‘i hold a wide range of uses and values including, for example, nearshore and onshore recreation, subsistence, tourism, cultural and historical significance, and ecological functions (Bremer et al. 2022). Although the public in Hawai‘i enjoys strong beach access rights (Vance and Wallsgrove 2006), the disappearing shoreline along many sections of sandy coastline can make traversal difficult and often impossible. As beaches erode, waves wash increasingly inland, sometimes extending State jurisdiction landward to the point where private land becomes public. This leads many homeowners to attempt to protect their private property, often illegally, by using land protection measures such as moving sand or building seawalls (Cocke 2014, 2020a, b, 2021).\\n\\nA compounding public health impact of SLR is the inundation of OSDS (Whittier and El-Kadi 2014; Habel et al. 2017). A large amount of waste disposal on O‘ahu occurs on-site and nearly 1500 OSDS are located within 200 ft of the shoreline; over 75% of total OSDS were cesspools as of 2014 (Whittier and El-Kadi 2014). State tax credits of up to $10,000 for homeowner cesspool upgrades were passed in 2015 (Act 120, 2015) and expanded in 2017 (Act 125, 2017). Upgrading every cesspool in the state, a legal requirement by 2050, is estimated to cost $2B at an average of $23,000 each (Act 125, 2017; State of Hawai‘i Department of Health, 2021).\\n\\nData and methods\\n\\nThis study’s methods build upon the body of literature evaluating the impacts of SLR exposure on residential property values. A contribution of our study is that we employ more comprehensive measures of SLR impacts than what are typically applied in the literature. In addition to the impacts of expected passive flooding on current property values that have been used in other studies (Bernstein et al. 2019; Murfin and Spiegel 2020; Tyndall 2021), we use projections of expected annual high wave run-up and exacerbated coastal erosion. The hedonic model also controls for other important aspects of coastal property values on O‘ahu: OSDS, seawalls (both on the property and adjacent properties), sandy beachfronts (in comparison to rocky coastline), and waterways that are also impacted by SLR-induced flooding (like canals).\\n\\n### Data\\n\\n#### Sea level rise data\\n\\nWe employ two different datasets for SLR. The first was developed by the Hawaiʻi Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission (2021) and represents 3.2 ft of SLR in a\\n---\\n## Overlay PacIOOS 3.2 ft SLR Exposure Measures Near Sandy Beach; Oahu\\n\\nFig. 1 Visualization of PacIOOS SLR attributes passive flooding (“bathtub”) model (called SLR-PF) along with separable projections for expected coastal erosion and high wave run-up. Annual high wave flooding (called SLR-AHWF) estimates average annual exposure to wave activity and its inland migration with SLR (Anderson et al. 2018). Coastal erosion (called SLR-CE) measures the exacerbated erosion of sandy beaches based on historical beach erosion patterns and projected inland migration under SLR. A comprehensive measure (called SLR-XA) is the greatest boundary of all three (Anderson et al. 2018). We identify a parcel to be affected by SLR if more than 30% of its area is projected to be inundated. Figure 1 shows each attribute’s projections under 3.2 ft of SLR and Fig. 2 visualizes the percentage of exposed coastal properties.\\n\\nFigure 1 illustrates how the three main PacIOOS SLR definitions interact and in some cases overlap using Sandy Beach on O‘ahu as a representative stretch of coastline.\\n\\nFigure 2 displays the percentage of TMK parcels within .25 miles of the coastline (coastal only sample) which are exposed to the PacIOOS 3.2 ft SLR-XA measure for each census tract on O‘ahu. These percentages are calculated based on exposed parcels rather than properties, so multi-family dwellings and apartment buildings are counted as single parcels in this illustration.\\n\\nThe second SLR dataset we use is from NOAA, which measures passive flooding up to 6 ft (Marcy et al. 2011). We use this to compare our analysis to prior work as well as higher projections of SLR.\\n\\n1 This modeling is done only for sandy beachfront areas and ignores the existence of seawalls (University of Hawaiʻi Coastal Geology Group and Tetra Tech Inc., 2017).\\n\\n2 In sensitivity analysis, we look at a range of cutoffs for identifying parcels as “inundated by SLR,” from 10 to 50%. As expected, a lower cut-off narrows the sample size substantially while a higher cut-off puts too many parcels that are substantially impacted by SLR into the control group. As a second robustness check, we also looked at other definitions of inundation, such as the inundation of the centerpoint of the parcel. Results are qualitatively similar.\\n---\\n## Ouhu Coastal TMK Parcel Exposure\\n\\nFig. 2 Share of the parcels within .25 miles from the coastline that are exposed to 3.2 ft SLR-XA\\n\\n### Housing characteristics data\\n\\nOur housing transaction price data comes from Zillow (ZTRAX), provided from 1994 to 2019, and is illustrated in Fig. 3. The ZTRAX dataset contains basic property and building attributes including square footage, building age, number of bedrooms, transaction date, and sale price for each transacted property.\\n\\nSimilar to prior studies like Keys and Mulder (2020), we separate our analysis into several time periods. Though we have data going back to 1994, we use a main specification from 2014 to 2019 (and do sensitivity analysis around this cutoff). We decided on the time period from 2014 for two reasons. The first is that IPCC AR5 was published in 2014, drawing increased attention to SLR. The second, perhaps a reflection of the first, is that there was an increased magnitude of Google searches for “sea level rise” starting in 2014, both nationwide and in Hawaiʻi (Google Trends (n.d)).\\n\\nWe add data relating to the presence of seawalls, FEMA flood zones, OSDS, proximity to the coast, and whether the coast has a sandy beach. Data on OSDS were collected from the Statewide GIS Program and included locations of OSDS across O‘ahu as of 2010. The FEMA flood zone data, last updated for 2021, was similarly sourced from the Hawai‘i Statewide GIS Program. We employ a shapefile of shoreline armoring across O‘ahu compiled through satellite photography analysis (Romine 2013; Romine and Fletcher 2012; Romine and Fletcher 2013) and updated by site visits as part of unpublished research by Amaya et al. (2021).\\n\\nAmaya, A., Brucal, A., and Lynham, J. (2021) Beggar-thy-neighbor’s beach: The social cost of adaptation to sea-level rise. Unpublished manuscript. Properties neighboring seawall installations (though not protected themselves) were identified by applying 20 m buffers to the seawall geometries and selecting properties which are within these buffer zones yet not protected by seawalls themselves.\\n---\\n## Average Property Sale Prices from 1994-2018 by Census Tract for Oahu\\n\\nFig. 3 Average property transaction prices in 1994–2018 (inflation-adjusted) by census tract on O‘ahu\\n\\nData compilation and descriptive statistics\\n\\nTo better control for the premium placed on O‘ahu properties near sandy beachfront areas, we create two samples as well as several additional variables. Our two samples are coastal and coastal + waterway. In our coastal sample, we include all properties within 0.25 miles of the physical coastline of O‘ahu. In our coastal + waterway sample, we include the coastal sample as well as parcels that are within 0.25 miles of SLR impacted waterways, such as canals and ocean-connected marsh areas. Figure 4 illustrates an example of an urban waterway in the area around Waikīkī, O‘ahu, with 1 m of SLR flooding. The “study area boundary” represents the quarter mile buffer area.\\n\\nThe additional variables created to help control for the price premiums placed on beach and waterfront adjacent housing include indicators for waterfront, beachfront, and non-coastal properties. Waterfront properties are identified as any parcels that lie within a 50-m buffer zone surrounding O‘ahu’s physical coastline. Beachfront properties are similarly identified as parcels that lie within 50- and 100-m buffer zones drawn around sandy beaches. Non-coastal properties are identified in the coastal + waterway sample as those which are at least 85 m closer to the nearest waterway than to the nearest stretch of coastline. Lastly, we also use an ocean view variable (provided by Zillow’s ZTRAX dataset) that describes whether each property has a clear view of the ocean.\\n\\nWe chose 85 m as the identification threshold for Non-coastal properties by testing thresholds between 20 and 105 m at 5-m intervals for model performance and identification strength. From this testing, we found that 85 m performed best as a Non-coastal identification threshold in terms of model \\xad R2 values, though the magnitude and statistical significance of our primary results were confirmed to be highly robust to the use of different identification thresholds for Non-coastal properties.\\n---\\n## Inland Projected PacIOOS SLR Exposure Around Canals and Waterways\\n\\nFig. 4 3.2 feet SLR exposure along the coastline and the canal around Waikīkī, O‘ahu\\n\\nTable 1\\nDescriptive Statistics by SLR exposure as measured by SLR-XA\\n\\nTable 1 provides the descriptive statistics by SLR exposure as measured by SLR-XA for all variables used within the main hedonic analysis (sample 2014–2019), and Table 2 breaks the same data apart by SLR exposure (as measured by SLR-XA).\\n\\nThe average sale price of a single-family property on O‘ahu from 2014 to 2019 was $1.28 million (coastal + waterway sample), and multi-family dwelling units had a lower average sale price, at $650,000 (see Supplementary Information). Our sample transactions are 37% for single family homes, the remainder for multi-family. The transaction prices within the smaller coastal sample are quite similar in their range. In addition, about a fifth of properties in our sample have an ocean view. Within the coastal sample, 16% of properties are adjacent to a sandy beach (beach front). About 5% of properties in the coastal sample have a seawall, and 6% of properties that lack a seawall have at least one neighbor with one. Lastly, 6% of properties in the coastal and 4% in the coastal + waterway samples have OSDS. As Table 1 indicates, the coastal + waterway sample includes transactions of houses that are more than 1.8 miles (2.9km) away from the coast but are within 0.25 miles from the nearest waterway. This sample captures many SLR-exposed transactions that the conventional coastal sample does not contain.\\n\\nTable 2 further illustrates the distinctions between our coastal and coastal + waterway samples. The mean and standard deviation values for each variable differ in both samples between properties which are exposed to PacIOOS 3.2ft comprehensive SLR (SLR-XA) and those which are not exposed. Additional t-tests have been conducted to determine whether the differences between the exposed and non-exposed means can be considered statistically significant.\\n\\nThe mean sales price for SLR-exposed properties is higher in both of our samples, in comparison to unexposed properties, with the difference being statistically significant at the 5% level for the coastal + waterway sample. The transaction price of single-family homes tends to be higher for those exposed to SLR than those unexposed. The opposite holds for multi-family (apartment) units: those exposed to SLR are priced lower on average than those unexposed (see Supplementary Information). Aside from climate change-related risks, homes closer to\\n---\\n## Table 1 Descriptive statistics (2014–2019)\\n\\n| |Man|SLl Da:Cuilul| |Man|Su Dek-|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Sales Price (USD)|897,616|1,298,05q|50,000|15,527,30|771,23}|1,042,409|50M|25,527,J00|\\n|Sales Price (ZOISUSD)|935,45]|13345|242|27,458,680|415512|1,082 J2}|\\n|64- [COl| |ucU| |17.+08| |17 4|\\n|Single-Family| | | | | | |1|for single-family units; 0 for multi-family or apartment units|\\n|Ocean View| | | | | | | | |\\n|Cesspool| | | | | | | |presence of onsite cesspool|\\n|Flood Zone| | | | | | | |whether the parcel belongs to the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event as classified by FEMA|\\n|Waterfront| | | | | | | | |\\n|Beach Front| | | | | | | | |\\n|Seawall| | | | | | | | |\\n|Neighbor Seawalls| | | | | | | | |\\n|These samples consist of property transactions priced between $50,000 and $50,000,000| | | | | |\\n\\nTable 1 illustrates the differences in property attributes between transacted properties within 0.25 miles\\nof the coast (coastal only) and transacted properties within 0.25 miles of either the coast or the nearest\\nSLR-exposed waterway (coastal + waterway). Single-family (=1 for single-family units; =0 for multi-family or apartment units), ocean view, cesspool (presence of onsite cesspool), flood zone (whether the parcel belongs to the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event as classified by FEMA), waterfront, beach front (proximity to a sandy beach within 50m or 100m), seawall, and neighbor seawalls (the parcel does not face seawalls but its neighbor within 20m does) are indicator variables.\\n\\nThese samples consist of property transactions priced between $50,000 and $50,000,000. The beach tend to be more valuable (Atreya and Czajkowski 2019; Conroy and Milosch 2011; Tyndall 2021). Other housing attributes (building square footage and the number of bedrooms) as well as coastal risk factors demonstrate statistically significant differences between exposed and non-exposed properties within our two samples. Notably, a higher proportion of the properties exposed to 3.2 ft SLR are in the flood zone, in the waterfront, and have seawalls. They also tend to have a smaller square footage and fewer bedrooms. There are multiple potential explanations for this, including simply a response to higher prices. These basic statistical observations of our datasets indicate the need to control for observable differences when estimating the price differences between SLR-exposed and non-exposed properties.\\n\\nLastly, Fig. 5 shows the proportion of transacted properties in our main study period (2014–2019) that are exposed to SLR as estimated by the NOAA data.

These samples consist of property transactions priced between $50,000 and $50,000,000 size, the age of the house, the number of bedrooms), and εit the error term. As in Bernstein et al. (2019), we introduce the variables μb to classify each transaction into a. Unlike Bernstein et al. (2019), we are unable to account for either climate change beliefs or investor/ owner-occupied homes. Because we are using data within only one county, and we do not have survey data mirroring home transactions, the role of beliefs is unfortunately outside the abilities of our analysis. For investor/owner-occupied homes, our limitation is related to the ZTRAX database for Hawai‘i. This field has numerous incomplete data entries and dropping these observations would give us an untenably small sample size. Other regional studies, such as Tyndall (2021), are also unable to incorporate beliefs and do not separate investor-owned properties from owner-occupied ones. Table A2 in our Supplementary Information summarizes the estimation result when the sample is limited to those zip code areas without recent disaster events.\\n---\\n## Fig. 5 NOAA SLR exposure statistics for transacted properties (2014–2019)\\n\\n| |Corala Only Samnk|Corala Watanya Samnk|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|2 / &| | |\\n\\nBin defined by the interaction of dummy variables that help us identify the effects of SLR exposure on the transaction price.

For example, properties subject to SLR may be waterfront or close to sandy beaches, which would likely raise the property value. In addition, the presence of shoreline hardening may also affect the property value. Thus our next two models address additional coastal amenities and risk factors to improve identification by more fully accounting for factors that affect coastal real estate values in Hawai‘i:\\n\\nln P it = 훽SLRE i + R1i훾r + Xit훾x + 휇b + 휀it, (2)\\n\\nln P it = 훽SLRE i + R1i훾r + R2i훽2 + Xit훾x + 휇b + 휀it, (3)\\n\\nwhere R1i represents the presence of ocean view, the presence of a cesspool, whether the parcel is located in a FEMA flood zone, whether the property is waterfront, and whether the property is beachfront (i.e., whether the property is located within 50m or 100m of a sandy beach). Vector R2i indicates whether the property has a seawall and whether a property without a seawall has a neighbor with seawalls.\\n\\nln P it = 훽SLRE i + R1i훾r + R2i훽2 + (SLREi * R2i)훽3 + 훽4 * (SLREi * SFit)Xit훾x + 휇b + 휀it, (4)\\n\\nIn our last specification, we add an interaction term between SLR exposure and the seawall indicator, as well as the property type (single-family housing) indicator SF. For all specifications, we cluster the standard errors at the zip code level.\\n\\nWith these four model specifications, we use several different assumptions about SLR exposure. In the first, we measure SLR exposure by the SLR-XA, meaning the union of\\n---\\n## Page 12 of 21\\n\\nClimatic Change (2023) 176:130\\n\\npassive flooding, wave run-up, and coastal erosion. Next we unpack these different types of SLR risks and hazards (into SLR-PF, SLR-AHWF, and SLR-CE). We also make runs only with NOAA’s passive flooding measure of SLR, and increase in one foot increments from 3 to 6 ft. Lastly, we estimate model (3) for different time periods going back to 1994.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n### Results with and without coastal risk factors\\n\\nTable 3 lists the main regression results of models (1), (2), and (3) by using SLR-XA 3.2ft as the measurement of SLR exposure.\\n\\nThe result of model (1), which follows the identification strategy by Bernstein et al. (2019) and includes distance, elevation, neighborhood, and transaction-year bins, fails to find a statistical relationship between our measure of SLR exposure and transaction prices (in either the coastal or coastal + waterway samples).\\n\\nModels (2) and (3) demonstrate that, once we incorporate other coastal risk factors, there is a statistically measurable relationship between SLR and transaction price, for both the coastal and coastal + waterway samples. Whereas there is a negative 10–12% estimate in the coastal sample, it is larger, negative 13–15%, in the coastal + waterway sample. The magnitude of the effects of SLR exposure on the property price is comparable to the estimates by Bernstein et al. (2019) (i.e., about −0.14 for 2–3ft SLR and about −0.075 for 4–5ft SLR).\\n\\nWe find that coastal attributes such as being water- and/or beachfront, as well as having an ocean view, are positive and statistically significant. We find some evidence of a relationship between the parcel having a seawall, and it is positive with a large magnitude (45%), though only significant at the 10% level in model (2), coastal + waterway sample. This finding, though not consistent through model specifications, suggests that the private economic incentive to harden the shoreline in the face of SLR could be substantially large. However, we do not detect negative spillover effects of neighbors’ seawalls on the property prices. We find across both samples of models (2) and (3) that the presence of OSDS has a statistically significant negative relationship to transaction price. The magnitude is negative 16% in the coastal sample and negative 10% in the coastal + waterway sample. We find no evidence that houses in our sample located in the FEMA flood zone are priced lower than comparable houses outside of the flood zone. This result is consistent with the finding of Hino and Burke (2021) that the property owners do not seem to fully incorporate the discount associated with flood zone designation in the housing prices across the USA. Lastly, we find in model (4) that our results for the effects of SLR exposure on transaction prices are largely explained by multi-family units.\\n\\nTable 4 reports the regression results with SLR-XA decomposed to different types of exposures (passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion).\\n\\nBoth AIC and BSC indicate that model (4) is the most preferred followed by (3) and then (2) for both the coastal and coastal + waterway samples.\\n---\\n| |Coasta|Loasta + atcnvay|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|SLYA1Z|-0.080|0.119\"|\\n| |(0065)|(0,039)|\\n| |0706\"|0 795 4|\\n| |(0.080)|(0,076)|\\n|Ccspool|-016|05\"|\\n| |(0.052)|(0.055)|\\n|Flood zonc|0111|0404|\\n| |(0,098)|(0.109)|\\n| |0343~|0273\\'|\\n| |(0,105)|(008A)|\\n|Beach (50)|0,012|0.084|\\n| |\\'0a61|(0.175)|\\n|Beach (100)|0249t|0244\"|\\n| |(0,094)|(0.089)|\\n|scawal| |037u|\\n| | |(0269)|\\n|Neighbor with seaualls| |0105|\\n| | |(0,107)|\\n| |0 531| |\\n| |(0.591)| |\\n|SLLUDZ*smelc-tamin| |0265\"|\\n| | |(0.095)|\\n|Nonroittal|\\'0162|00171~|\\n| |oMsti|(0.057)|\\n\\nThe table represents the regression results of models (1)–(4) with SLR-XA 3.2 ft as the indicator of SLR risk exposure.

One explanation is that passive flooding of this magnitude represents a more chronic event, whereas both high wave run-up and coastal erosion can be more seasonal in nature. The positive coefficient estimates for both high wave run-up and coastal erosion are potentially puzzling (statistically significant in multiple specifications), but we explain this finding as a reflection of being close to high surf and sandy beaches for which O‘ahu is world renowned.

The coefficient estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals are based on model (2).\\n\\nAlthough we attempted to control for this attribute via our two beach front indicators, we conclude that these variables imperfectly capture the premium associated with proximity to sandy beaches. Specifically, our beach front indicator does not capture whether a parcel is across the street from a sandy beach or on the same side as the beach, which would have a potentially large impact in terms of parcel protection from SLR-induced hazards. In addition, our measure of coastal erosion, based on a modeling assessment, is also an imperfect measure of erosion because it does not take into account the presence of seawalls. As noted earlier, the measure of SLR-induced coastal erosion is subject to a larger degree of uncertainty than passive flooding and annual high wave flooding indicators (Anderson et al. 2018, and personal communication with SLR modelers).\\n\\n## Property price effects by the extent of exposure\\n\\nFigure 6 represents the coefficient estimate of exposure to passing flooding based on NOAA SLR measures with 95% confidence intervals.\\n\\nIn contrast to the finding by Bernstein et al. (2019) for the US national sample, we find that the negative and significant relationship between SLR and transaction price dissipates after the 3 ft scenario. While our restricted sample size is clearly an issue in comparison to a US-wide analysis, the localized result indicates that home buyers did not discount housing values for SLR risks that are not expected, on average, to be realized by 2100.\\n\\n## Market saliency\\n\\nIn this section, we look at alternative sample periods, going back to 1994 as this is what is available to us from ZTRAX. For simplicity, we break our sample into four time periods:\\n\\nTo address this challenge, we ran multiple sensitivity tests for the measure “beach front,” with alternative definitions ranging from 50- to 150-m buffer zones. Our results remained similar to what is presented in Tables 6 and 7.\\n\\nWe find that SLR does not statistically significantly impact transaction prices when measured at 2 feet; however, this is likely an issue of quite small sample size. The magnitude of the coefficients remain similar.\\n\\nWe note that the point estimates for 3ft SLR according to NOAA’s passive flooding measures are different from what Table 4 indicates given the SLR-XA indicator for 3.2ft exposure because the two measures identify overlapping but different sets of parcels as exposed to SLR.\\n---\\n## Page 16 of 21\\n\\nClimatic Change (2023) 176:130\\n\\nFig. 7\\nThe SLR impacts on property prices by sample period.\\n2014-10\\n20.07-1E\\nNote: The figure demonstrates the % change in house price of the properties exposed to SLR-XA 3.2ft (relative to unexposed properties) based on different sample periods for the coastal + waterway sample. The coefficient estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals are based on model (2) 2014–2019 (main model), 2007–2013, 2000–2006, and 1994–2000. Supplementary Information contains additional sensitivity analyses regarding the sample period specification. Our core findings that more recent transactions reflect negative market impacts as a result of SLR considerations and that transactions prior to the year 2000 do not remain. Figure 7 shows our findings in regard to the SLR coefficient (model (2) with coastal + waterway sample). We find that SLR is negatively associated with housing transaction prices back to the year 2000, and from 1994 to 1999, it is positive. The magnitude of the estimated coefficients are increasingly negative in each more recent block of time, showing the increasing salience of SLR and associated risks in O‘ahu’s housing market.\\n\\n## Behavioral implications\\n\\nFollowing Bernstein et al. (2019) and similarly leveraging Giglio et al. (2015a, b), we estimate the average O‘ahu home buyer’s risk perception as it relates to housing prices and SLR. We consider that a house provides net benefits to the homeowner each year (B), with a positive annual discount rate (r>0). The net present value of the house (Vu), if it is not exposed to SLR and provides the net benefit indefinitely, is given by: Vu = Σ∞(t=0) (1 + r)^t = B/r.\\n\\nHowever, suppose a house with the same annual net benefits is subject to SLR and is expected to be flooded in T years, whereby the annual net benefit drops to zero after year T. The net present value of the house facing SLR (Ve) is then given by: Ve = Σ(t=0)^T (1 + r)^tB = B(r - r(1 + r)TB).\\n\\nOur estimate of 𝛽̂ in models (1)-(3) informs the relationship between Vu and Ve: ln(Ve/Vu) = ln(1 - (1 + r)^T1) = 𝛂 𝛽.\\n---\\n## Table 5\\n\\n|Market-expected timing of SLR risk|Waterway|\\n|---|---|\\n|Discount rate|[95% Conf. Interval|Model (2)|237.4|181.1|116.1|209.1|171.1|277.1|\\n|Model (3)|220.3|47.5|323.2|195.5|163.7|246.2|\\n|2.604|Model (2)|702|157.4|BL|663|107.4|\\n|Model (3)|85.4|673|125.3|75.8|634|955|\\n|Model (2)|484|36.9|82.8|42.6|34.9|565|\\n|Model (3)|44.9| |65.9| |334|502|\\n\\nWith r = 0.026 (Giglio et al. 2015a), our estimates indicate that the expected inundation time for 3.2ft SLR ranges between 75.8 years (with 95% confidence interval [63.4, 95.5]) and 92 years ([70.2, 157.4]). We can interpret these figures as the “market-expected timing of SLR risk,” which appear to be in line with the IPCC’s central projections of 3.2 ft SLR by the end of this century. Table 5 summarizes the expected inundation time T for 3.2 ft SLR under alternative discount rates of 1% and 5%. This exercise indicates that the estimated SLR discount on housing value for O‘ahu is, on average, in line with the scientific risks of SLR.\\n\\n## Aggregate effects\\n\\nAccording to the Hawaiʻi Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission (2017), the value of projected flooded land and dwellings exposed to 3.2 ft SLR amounts to over $19 billion across the State of Hawai‘i. Our study indicates that the current housing market has already incorporated a part of the losses ($222 to $542 million 2020 US dollars based on our range of model point estimates). This equates to $16.1–39.3 million of lost property sales tax revenue within SLR exposure areas for the City and County of Honolulu, based on applying effective property sales tax rates for residential parcels.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nOur hedonic study for O‘ahu finds a 9–14% price discount for housing property transactions expected to be impacted by 3.2 ft of passive flooding SLR between 2014 and 2019. Property transactions do not seem to incorporate seasonal SLR risk exposure (annual high wave run-up or future coastal erosion factors). This may be because exposure to seasonal flooding or coastal erosion is not as salient as chronic SLR, and is viewed as a more dynamic process in comparison to general inundation.\\n\\nOur analysis has several implications to inform coastal management strategies in the face of SLR. Our results robustly show that residential properties on O‘ahu, particularly multi-family dwelling units, have already experienced sizable relative discounts in their sales price due to current and expected SLR. As such, single family homes are yet to have measurable negative transaction price impacts from current and expected SLR. We hypothesize that first measurable impacts appear in multi-family dwelling residences due to the complexity of coordinating building-scale SLR response within condominium and/or apartment regimes, for example, in gaining agreement amongst unit owners on SLR response actions within homeowners associations. Moreover, buyers are increasingly accounting for SLR within transaction prices—and this trend is likely to\\n---\\n## Page 18 of 21\\n\\nClimatic Change (2023) 176:130\\n\\ncontinue with increasing SLR and public information about the localized impacts of climate change. This finding therefore helps to inform the timing and form of potential government programs aimed at coastal realignment—i.e., that would attempt to proactively retreat from O‘ahu’s coastline to preserve its sandy beaches. Many government buyout programs, particularly for those exposed to natural disasters, use pre-disaster, fair market values—as under FEMA (Greer and Brokopp Binder 2017). More aggressive condemnation approaches would similarly require just compensation of homeowners (Craig, 2019). However, this kind of large-scale buyout scheme is often thought to be infeasible given the magnitude of the challenge posed by accelerated SLR (Griggs and Reguero 2021). Understanding the pricing trends of homes within the SLR-XA, especially for those closest to the ocean, can therefore productively guide decision-makers to better understand average homeowner risk tolerance, expectations around collective action problems prompted by multi-dwelling units, and guide the development of retreat programs in comparison to, and the context of, market forces.\\n\\nOur research also points to the importance of incorporating a comprehensive model of housing and coastal attributes within local SLR research, as we find the impact of related factors such as the presence of an ocean view, OSDS, and proximity to the ocean or beach. A particularly robust finding within the specifications of our model is that the presence of an OSDS, including cesspools, lower property transaction prices. The State’s ACT 125 (2017) requires the replacement of all cesspools (more than 4700 in the area, 550 in SLR-XA) by 2050, and this has been primarily approached with government financing of cesspool upgrades (to septics) without consideration of SLR exposure (Spirandelli et al., 2019). Our finding that the value of OSDS is statistically significant and negatively capitalized into home transaction prices suggests that OSDS could potentially be converted effectively and efficiently upon sale. SLR-enhanced coastal erosion and groundwater inundation of these systems pose substantial public health and ecological threats. Conversion of such systems should be duly managed within the coastal zone. Such coastal management issues are an area for future inquiry. Lastly, in 2021, the State of Hawai‘i passed Act 179 that mandates properties in the SLR-XA to disclose this risk to potential real estate buyers. The law went into effect in May 2022 and thus provides for an excellent future study of market adjustment to increasing information about homebuyer risk within Hawai‘i’s coastal zone.\\n\\nSupplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-023-03602-4.\\n\\nAvailability of data and materials: The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available on request except for the variables related to the housing transaction and assessment.

Fletcher & Tiffany R. Anderson Shoreline hardening, which causes beach loss globally, will accelerate with sea level rise (SLR), causing more beach loss if management practices are not changed. To improve beach conservation efforts, current and future shoreline hardening patterns on sandy beaches need deeper analysis. A shoreline change model driven by incremental SLR (0.25, 0.46, 0.74 m) is used to simulate future changes in the position of an administrative hazard zone, as a proxy for risk of hardening at all sandy beaches on the island of O‘ahu, Hawai ‘i. In Hawai ‘i, hardening can be triggered when evidence of erosion is within 6.1 m (“20 ft”) of certain structures, allowing an applicant to request emergency protection. Results show an increase in shoreline vulnerability to hardening with SLR governed by backshore land use patterns. The largest increase (+ 7.6%) occurred between modern-day and 0.25 m of SLR (very likely by year 2050) with half of all beachfront shoreline at risk by 0.74 m of SLR. Maximum risk of shoreline hardening and beach loss is projected to occur from modern-day and near-term hardening because of the heavily developed aspect of some shoreline segments. Adaptation to SLR should be considered an immediate need—not solely a future issue. Beaches are critical ecosystems1, storm buffers2, an essential cultural setting3, and an attraction for tourists4. However, poor management of shoreline hardening, the construction of hard structures such as seawalls along the shore, has led to beach narrowing and loss around the world5–8 (Fig. 1). Hardening the shoreline prevents property erosion and protects backshore development from erosional hazards. However, it causes “coastal squeeze”9 or beach narrowing and eventual loss on chronically retreating shorelines10, an inevitability with sea level rise (SLR)10–12. This study analyzes current and future shoreline hardening patterns with SLR to improve the understanding of future challenges related to beach conservation. Shoreline erosion is projected to occur along more of the shoreline as well as accelerate rates of erosion due to SLR13–15, increasing the length of shoreline at risk of hardening and beach loss if poor management practices continue. By the end of the century, SLR may cause half of the sandy beaches globally to disappear driven by shoreline dynamics and coastal recession alone15. With dense populations living near the coast now16 and likely in the future17, pressure to continue development alongshore and to protect existing development from rising sea level may lead to more shoreline hardening, and by extension beach loss. Gittman et al.18 estimated 14% of the US coastline has been hardened with strong correlation to population density, predicting one third of the shoreline could be hardened by 2100 if coastal populations continue to increase and the shoreline hardening rates stay the same (+200 km/year). Current and future potential hardening patterns need to be considered when managing sandy shorelines, especially under the context of SLR, because of its degrading effect on the health of sandy beaches6. While much research has been done to understand the effect of shoreline hardening around the world (China19, Southern Europe20, Portugal21, United States1, Puerto Rico22, for example), research focused on the potential drivers for current and future hardening is limited. Gittman et al.18 compared hardening patterns to housing density, gross domestic product, coastal slope, accretion/erosion rates, geomorphology, mean tidal range, mean wave height, relative SLR, storm frequency, shoreline positions, and years since shoreline hardening was banned in that area for the coastline in the continental US. They offered future predictions of shoreline hardening development based on the understanding of the parameters described above. However, the effect of accelerated SLR was not considered. Others explore the effect of accelerated SLR on coastal assets, however, do not go into depth to understand current and future shoreline hardening patterns12,23.

Hardening to protect backshore assets has resulted in widespread beach loss in Hawaiʻi. Photo of Koʻolauloa shoreline in March 2020 provided by contributing author Kammie-Dominique Tavares.\\n\\nTo further this line of research and provide coastal managers and stakeholders with improved understanding of the impacts of shoreline hardening related to accelerated SLR, a chronology of threatened beach resources is established in combination with an analysis of backshore land use. In this study, local shoreline hardening management practices are applied to a shoreline change model that projects future erosion and shoreline retreat to create administrative erosion hazard zones for all historically sandy shorelines on the Hawaiian island of Oʻahu (Fig. 2). Categorized by land use, parcels hardened and at risk of hardening (within the administrative erosion hazard zones) were identified using shoreline change projections under three SLR scenarios (0.25, 0.46, and 0.74 m). Oʻahu is used as a living laboratory of land use decisions, and, by extension, these results are indicative of beach conservation stresses in similar situations around the world.\\n\\nStudy site. Located in the North-Central Pacific, the island of Oʻahu (Fig. 2) is a volcanic island characterized by a fringing reef that creates alongshore variability, producing embayment and headland coastlines that are both carbonate and igneous in origin. Beach development is dominated by longshore transport with overall historical shoreline change rates generally stable to accreting in embayed beaches and eroding in headland areas. The backshore consists of a mixture of carbonate, marine and aeolian sediments produced from the withdraw of the Kapapa High Stand (3500–5000 year B.P.) and subsequent dune formation.\\n\\nOʻahu is exposed to a highly variable and diverse wind-wave climate. As a result, shoreline orientation is a fundamental parameter affecting beach characteristics. Oʻahu can be characterized by four principal orientations (north, east, south, and west). The north shore of Oʻahu experiences large winter swells generated by low pressure centers in the North Pacific. The west shore is characterized by both refracted winter and summer swells. The south shore of Oʻahu, exposed to summer swell and oblique trade wind waves, is the most heavily developed coastline on the island. The east side of the island experiences trade wind waves and, at its northernmost and southernmost ends, seasonally refracted swell. Projected shoreline changes island wide as well as for each of these directional segments are characterized.\\n\\nBeach management on Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi. In the U.S., partnerships between federal and local governments established management of coastal resources through the National Coastal Zone Management Program (NCZMP) under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Based on NCZMP criteria, states design their own programs and set their own objectives. In Hawaiʻi, the national and local partnership is based on Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes §§ 205A, the state Coastal Zone Management law, which declares protection of view planes, public access to and along the shoreline, and conservation of coastal ecosystems, especially beaches, as the primary purpose of beach management efforts. Summers et al. established that despite Hawaiʻi’s robust legal and planning framework, there has been a failure to achieve stated goals, especially due to poor management of shoreline hardening.\\n\\nWith a population of nearly 1 million people, heavy development of homes, hotels, roads, and beach parks has occurred along Oʻahu’s shoreline and has infringed upon most beach dunes, leaving few natural dune systems in place. All of this has subsequently been developed in the modern day CZM program with a statewide setback of 40 ft from the highest wash of the waves. Development was managed under the assumption that\\n\\nScientific Reports | (2020) 10:13633 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70577-y\\n---\\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\\n\\nHawaiian Islands\\n\\nKauai 100 mi O\\'anu\\n\\n10mi Paumald (Sunset beach) Kahuku Hawai i\\n\\nKa ena Oahu 10km Point Hale iwa Kaaawa Kane\\'ohe BayKane ohe Kailua Waimanalo Makapuu Point\\n\\nJQOQ Wal \\' anae Ewa (Pearl Harbor)ailport Honolulu Maunalua (Hawai\" Kai)\\n\\nFigure 2.

Conceptual diagram of shoreline development and structures at risk of hardening in modern-day (2011–15) and future erosion hazard zones (0.25, 0.46, and 0.74 m of sea level rise).\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nThe greatest threat to beach conservation under conditions of accelerating SLR is shoreline hardening. To provide managers with improved understanding of this problem, a three-step process was used: (1) projecting future shoreline position and rate of change under three SLR scenarios using the probabilistic method described in Anderson et al.13, (2) identifying backshore parcels and their development pattern where an administrative trigger for hardening is crossed (20 ft buffer); and 3) defining land use categories that have historically been most likely to be hardened (Fig. 3).\\n\\nFuture shoreline projection.\\n\\nMany models used to project shoreline change resulting from SLR fail to include historical data and, therefore, do not provide results reflecting site-specific parameters. Other models use projections of historical change without taking into account the accelerating nature of global mean SLR. In this paper, the method described in Anderson et al.13 is used because it provides an approach that accommodates both of these needs by combining historical patterns of beach change with a geometric equilibrium profile model to identify shoreline retreat in response to SLR. Because the shoreline of O‘ahu has been carefully mapped for historical rates of change, the method described in Anderson et al.13 offers an ideal opportunity to analyze projections of future shoreline change due to SLR and patterns of intersection with a database of backshore land use.\\n\\nUsing this method13, future shoreline positions are projected under three scenarios of SLR (0.25, 0.46, and 0.74 m). The SLR scenarios refer to the median probability values in the IPCC AR5 report, which correspond to the years 2050, 2075, and 2100 respectively for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. The RCP 8.5 “business as usual” greenhouse gas concentration pathway was used in this study as results are intended to inform the development of land use policies in a low-risk tolerance framework.\\n\\nThe shoreline change model combines the long-term historical shoreline change rate with the conceptual geometric Bruun-type model of beach profile adjustment to SLR by Davidson-Arnott, to project future shoreline positions and rates of change under each scenario. The projected amount of net shoreline change is characterized by a joint probability density function (pdf) that includes uncertainties arising from the historical shoreline change methodology, the geometric model, and the IPCC AR5 sea level projections. From this pdf, the shoreline change that corresponds to the mode (or maximum probability density) is used to represent the most likely amount of projected net shoreline change in each scenario. It is important to note that, while the method does capture spatially varying sediment behavior, this type of simplified approach cannot account for complex nonlinearities in sediment supply related to local geologic constraints and local variations in the rate of SLR. The reader is directed to the original method publication for a robust discussion of limitations to this approach.\\n\\nThe current vegetation line is used to represent the present-day administrative shoreline, as it is a reasonable approximation of the state’s shoreline definition, which describes the highest wash of the waves at high tide during the time of the year when the waves are highest. The vegetation line is not only an administrative feature but\\n\\nScientific Reports | (2020) 10:13633 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70577-y\\n---\\n## Residential Beach park Federal Unclassified\\n\\n|Definition|Residential|Beach park|Federal|Unclassified|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|TMK parcel with dwellings as well as golf courses|Hardening along the entire length of the parcel (up to 100 m on large parcels)|Hardening only in front of each threatened building, except for clustered cabins, in which shoreline hardening spans the length of clustered cabins (Hardening typically spans 60–120 m of shoreline in these categories)|No buildings were in this land use|Unclassified shoreline, typically roads or undeveloped land|\\n|Hardening to protect buildings| | | | |\\n|Hardening to protect transportation assets|Hardening only in front of the threatened portion of roadway or other transportation asset; except for cases where the greens of a golf course are located between the shoreline and a roadway that falls within a future administrative hazard zone, in which case hardening is assumed along the entire length of the shoreline fronting the golf course greens, following observed trends of hardening at golf courses| | | |\\n\\nTable 1.

The modeled net future shoreline change is projected from the modern vegetation line under each scenario and is referred to as a projected shoreline.\\n\\nShoreline hardening potential. Using GIS tools, the 20 ft buffer extending inland from each projected shoreline, referred to as the administrative erosion hazard zone in this paper, is identified and noted where it intersects habitable structures, transportation infrastructure, and public facilities. Erosional threats to these three assets have historically been the frequent trigger for hardening. The roofs of buildings were used to identify dwellings and public facilities. Transportation features were digitized on the most shore-parallel seaward edge.\\n\\nUsing GIS layers available online through the Hawaiʻi Office of Planning’s GIS Program, all backshore land use on the island of Oʻahu was classified into four major categories: residential, city and state beach parks, federal lands, and unclassified lands. While land use patterns may change over time, no change is assumed since predicting future land use is not possible.\\n\\nMosaics of shoreline imagery from 2011 to 2015, also used in the calculation of future shoreline position, are used as the baseline scenario to identify modern development.\\n\\nFrom this recent imagery, the locations of existing shoreline hardening were digitized. The extent of the observed portion of shoreline hardening within each parcel is largely determined by land use category. For example, when a residential building is threatened by erosion hazards, the typical response is to harden the entire length of the parcel that faces the ocean; conversely, threatened buildings in beach parks (often restroom facilities) are often protected by hardened shorelines that only front the particular building and leave the rest of the parcel unhardened. These observed patterns are used to estimate future hardening for buildings and transportation under each land use category. While actual future shoreline hardening patterns may differ, general patterns of hardening are assumed to estimate a likely scenario. Land use categories and hardened shorelines were identified to the parcel level and overlain with the administrative hazard zones. At these locations, a database was developed of alongshore length of at-risk parcels, land use category, presence or absence of modern hardening and the physical dimensions of the modern beach. The length of shoreline was measured for the following scenarios: “Hardened 2011–2015” (baseline, hardened), “At-risk 2011–2015″ (baseline, at-risk),” “At-risk 0.25 m,” “At-risk 0.46 m,” “At-risk 0.74 m,” and “Not At-risk”.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nAll sandy shoreline present in the early twentieth century, approximately 108 km or 60% of the entire Oʻahu shoreline, was analyzed. Average shoreline change rates were considered for the island by region.\\n\\nToday, over half of the shoreline is eroding (negative shoreline-change rates indicate erosion). The average shoreline change rate for the entire island is -0.03 ± 0.01 m/year. The eastern shoreline is the only region that has a positive average rate, indicating accretion; this result reflects significant beach lengths that have continued to accumulate sand as a result of unique geologic conditions even during a century of SLR. Along other portions of the east side, overdevelopment and inappropriate road placement have led to considerable shoreline hardening and beach loss.\\n\\nBy 0.25 m of SLR, every side of the island establishes a pattern of chronic erosion with the percent of eroding shoreline increasing, and the average rate of shoreline change becomes more erosive. Island-wide, under the highest SLR scenario of 0.74 m of SLR, the average percent of eroding shoreline is 89%. The most erosive segments of the island are on the west and north-facing shores, where nearly all portions of these two regions are experiencing chronic erosion with average rates of -0.44 ± 0.04 m/year and -0.30 ± 0.08 m/year, respectively.\\n\\nThe results of intersecting backshore characteristics with the erosion hazard zones reveal patterns of modern-day backshore land use on the sandy shorelines on Oʻahu. Of the shoreline analyzed, modern-day backshore land use is predominantly residential (40.5%) and government-owned beach parks (35.8%). The remaining categories (federal land and unclassified areas) together constitute approximately 23.7% of backshore land use. It is found that more than one-quarter of all Oʻahu’s sandy shoreline is presently hardened, mainly residential parcels.\\n\\nIn addition to 28.6% of sandy shoreline that is currently hardened, GIS analysis indicates another 3.5% of O‘ahu’s sandy shorelines are currently at risk of hardening when considering the 20 ft criteria for triggering an\\n---\\n|Region|SLR scenario|Shoreline change rate (m/year)|Percent eroding (%)|Percent accreting (%)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|North|Modern|− 0.07 ± 0.03|72|28|\\n| |0.25 m|− 0.20 ± 0.05|92|8|\\n| |0.46 m|− 0.25 ± 0.06|95|5|\\n| |0.74 m|− 0.30 ± 0.08|97|3|\\n| |Modern|0.04 ± 0.03|51|49|\\n|East|Modern|− 0.03 ± 0.01|52|48|\\n| |0.25 m|− 0.09 ± 0.03|72|28|\\n| |0.46 m|− 0.14 ± 0.05|78|22|\\n| |0.74 m|− 0.18 ± 0.07|82|18|\\n|South|Modern|− 0.20 ± 0.04|89|11|\\n| |0.25 m|− 0.14 ± 0.03|75|25|\\n| |0.46 m|− 0.19 ± 0.05|81|19|\\n| |0.74 m|− 0.23 ± 0.07|86|14|\\n|West|Modern|− 0.03 ± 0.01|61|39|\\n| |0.25 m|− 0.33 ± 0.04|97|3|\\n| |0.46 m|− 0.39 ± 0.04|98|2|\\n| |0.74 m|− 0.44 ± 0.04|98|2|\\n|All|0.25 m|− 0.16 ± 0.01|80|20|\\n| |0.46 m|− 0.21 ± 0.01|85|15|\\n| |0.74 m|− 0.25 ± 0.02|89|12|\\n\\n|Length (km)|Residential Development type|Beach park|Federal land|Unclassified|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|45|Not at-risk| | | |110|\\n|40|At-risk 0.74 m| | | | |\\n| |At-risk 0.46 m| | | | |\\n| |At-risk 0.25 m| | | | |\\n| |At-risk 2011-15| | | | |\\n|35|Hardened 2011-15| | | |50|\\n|30| | | | |40|\\n|25| | | | |30|\\n|20| | | | |20|\\n|15| | | | |10|\\n|10| | | | | |\\n|5| | | | | |\\n|0| | | | | |\\n---\\n## www.nature.com/scientificreports/\\n\\n|(a) 10|(b) 120|\\n|---|---|\\n|Residential|At risk of hardening|\\n|Beach park|Not at risk of hardening|\\n|9|Federal|\\n|7.6%|Unclassified|100|\\n|8| |\\n|Newly found length per SLR increment (km)| |\\n|7|6.4%|80|\\n|6|5.4%|60|\\n|5| |\\n|4|3.5%|40|\\n|3|51.5%|\\n|2|32.1%|39.7%|\\n|1| |\\n|0At-risk 2011-15|0-0.25|0.25-0.46|0.46-0.74|\\n|Increment of SLR (m)|SLR (m)|\\n\\nFigure 5.

At greatest risk are beach parks (1.6%) followed by residential lands (1.0%), while federal lands (0.7%) and unclassified land (0.1%) each constitute less than 1% of backshore land use at risk of new hardening.\\n\\nModel results indicate that, in addition to the 32.1% of sandy shoreline that is already hardened or at risk of hardening in the modern-day scenario, an additional 7.6% of O‘ahu’s sandy shoreline will be at risk of hardening under the 0.25 m of SLR scenario (very likely by the year 205042). Most of this additional at-risk area is associated with residential lands (3.4%) and with beach parks (3.0%). This increase between modern-day and 0.25 m of SLR scenario (7.6%) constitutes the largest increase of hardening risk between any of the consecutive SLR increments in this analysis (Figs. 4, 5a).\\n\\nWhile the total amount of hardened and at risk of hardening shorefront residential lands continues to increase between 0.25 and 0.46 m of SLR (Figs. 4, 5b), the increase is less than that over the previous SLR increment (modern-day to 0.25 m of SLR) for each land use category. Notably, residential uses had the largest decrease with 2.3% newly at-risk residential use compared to the increase between the modern-day and 0.25 m SLR scenarios (3.4% newly at-risk residential land) (Figs. 4, 5a). Beach parks have the largest increase (2.9% newly at-risk land) in this SLR increment.\\n\\nResults indicate that, with 0.74 m of SLR, approximately 51.5% of all sandy shorelines on Oʻahu will be hardened or at risk of hardening (Figs. 4, 5b). This constitutes an 80% increase compared to the amount of presently hardened shorelines. The highest SLR scenario triggers continued additional land at risk of hardening among all four land use categories. Newly identified (between 0.46 and 0.74 m of SLR) at-risk residential lands (1.7%), beach parks (2.6%) and unclassified lands (0.1%) indicate a slight reduction in the rate of new risk compared to lower SLR intervals, while federal land shows constant risk (Figs. 4, 5a).\\n\\nDiscussion Building on previous research of shoreline hardening patterns, this report analyzes the relationship of backshore land use and SLR on shoreline hardening. Future shoreline position and rate of change are projected under three SLR scenarios (0.25, 0.46, and 0.74 m). Applying the 20 ft buffer rule currently in use by shoreline managers, four backshore land use categories are identified that have historically been protected by hardening as a policy choice and which qualify for emergency permitting under each scenario, a proxy for risk of hardening. This study shows that SLR will likely increase shoreline erosion and, after 0.74 m of SLR, put a total of 51.5% of the beaches on the island at risk of hardening because of the nature of backshore land use. Consequently, more shoreline is expected to become vulnerable to beach loss, decreasing beach resources available for social, ecological, and economical uses. Unless proactive, collaborative, and conservation-oriented governance is developed, shoreline\\n\\nScientific Reports | (2020) 10:13633 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70577-y Vol.:(0123456789)\\n---\\nResults confirm the findings of Summer et al. that shoreline hardening has been used as the primary policy tool in response to chronic erosion. A total of 28.6% of all present-day sandy shoreline is already hardened, with another 3.5% found to be currently at risk of hardening. Data reveal that with only another 0.25 m of SLR, over 10% of still existing non-hardened beaches are at risk of being lost. When considering: 1) the amount of already hardened shoreline; 2) the current shoreline at risk of hardening because of assets located within 20 ft of active erosion; and 3) the model projections for hardening risk under 0.25 m of SLR, nearly 40% of beaches on Oʻahu face near-term critical management decisions that will determine their immediate conservation.\\n\\nAccording to Sweet et al. relative to the year 2000, global mean sea level is very likely (90–100% probability) to rise 0.15–0.38 m by 2050. Consequently, management decisions regarding beach conservation made today and in the next three decades will determine the continued existence of a significant portion of the beaches on Oʻahu and other coastlines in the world with similar SLR and development patterns. It is critically important that options are developed soon for beachfront landowners and resource managers to avoid further inappropriate management decisions.\\n\\n| |North Region|West Region|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Percentage of Shoreline Chronically Eroding|92%|97%|\\n|Average Erosion Rate|0.2 ± 0.05 m/year|0.33 ± 0.04 m/year|\\n\\nBeaches are large systems that work beyond land use categories, yet, are often managed on a parcel level. Beachfront residential areas highlight the challenge of managing sandy shorelines because of the many private landowners involved who currently have rights to harden their shoreline for their resources, while affecting other stakeholders and shorelines beyond their property. In this analysis, the primary land use category driving risk of beach loss is residential use. By the end of the century, more than half of the residential shoreline could be hardened or at risk of hardening, which is more than a quarter of all sandy shorelines on Oʻahu.\\n\\nThese results likely are conservative since the common phenomena of flanking, the chain reaction of shoreline hardening due to increased erosion at the ends of a hard structure, is not included in the methodology. Since most of the shoreline is residential, policies for those land use types should be addressed first followed by beach park, federal land, and unclassified land. Management of federal lands, the land use with the least clear pattern for shoreline hardening, may be improved from the patterns shown in the other land use types.\\n\\nThe main trigger for hardening in beach park and unclassified shoreline land use types is transportation assets. Beach park and unclassified shorelines experiencing chronic erosion will likely be allowed to recede until hardening for protection of the transportation assets is triggered, causing beach loss. This result suggests, again, that the critical time for beach conservation decisions is now and in the immediate future.\\n\\nInteragency collaborations and public–private partnerships have not been deeply explored as avenues of beach conservation on Oʻahu or statewide. However, these relationships are necessary because of the many stakeholders along the shore as demonstrated in this study. Research on collaborative management of resources with community participation should be explored for best practices. Because beaches are held in a public trust in Hawaiʻi, stakeholders not only include those who own the beach front land, which is outlined in this study, but also the public. The public is connected to the shoreline for recreational, social, and cultural reasons. Additionally, beaches are critical ecosystems tied seaward to nearshore reefs and landward to the indigenous and endemic-rich ecologies of coastal dunes. As erosional stress builds with SLR, collaboration will be key to successful management of sandy shorelines.\\n\\nAs identified by Summers et al., shoreline management is largely a reactive, parcel by parcel, system of choices in Hawaiʻi that diminishes the role of proactive and place-based decisions. This study demonstrates the complexity of simultaneously managing sandy shorelines as critical environments and as sites for infrastructure deployment and investment. This study is also an example of recognizing that the past is no longer a valid guide to the future, and that analyzing entrenched practices through the lens of science can provide new planning insights before it is too late to apply them. So-called strategic retreat from the shore offers an opportunity for sandy beach survival as well as community revitalization, but will likely come with financial and social challenges. However, action is necessary and likely less costly than inaction even with high uncertainties. Retreat may not be appropriate or possible for every shoreline, and alternatives based on local parameters should be considered. In the case of sandy beach conservation, poor shoreline hardening management practices have threatened beaches around the world historically and today and will continue if not changed. Data indicate the critical time for resolving this problem is now.\\n\\nScientific Reports | (2020) 10:13633 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70577-y\\n---\\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n\\n- Future shoreline projections under SLR scenarios, when analyzed in terms of backshore land use, provide a globally relevant warning to resource managers and stakeholders that modern-day and immediate near-term decisions strongly impact beach conservation.\\n- Modeling reveals that the maximum risk of shoreline hardening, and, by extension beach loss, peaks before mid-century.\\n- Residential lands, beach parks, federal lands, and unclassified lands (respectively) are in critical need of new management options focused on beach conservation.\\n- The reactive and piecemeal approach to beach management has failed under historic policies.

An understanding of the mode and timing of their formation is absent from our knowledge of the Quaternary history of Oahu.\\n\\nDuring the late Quaternary, eustatic sea level has fluctuated between -6 m above and 130 m below present sea level (Chappell and Shackleton 1986; Shackleton 1987). Presumably, these sea-level fluctuations were accompanied by vertical migration of marine and meteoric environments within the nearshore sediments of Oahu. Both of these diagenetic environments can leave characteristic petrographic and geochemical features.\\n\\nIn this paper, we describe depositional facies and report radiometric data that indicate the mode and timing of formation of the nearshore terrace. We also present petrographic and geochemical evidence of early shallow-marine, meteoric, and post-meteoric shallow-marine diagenesis. In addition, we discuss the extent to which the sedimentary petrology of these deposits augments our present understanding of near-shore Quaternary environments.\\n\\nGEOLOGIC SETTING\\n\\nOahu (21°27\\' N, 158° W) is a high volcanic island within the 3500 km long Hawaii-Emperor island-seamount chain. It is composed primarily of the eroded remnants of two great shield volcanoes. Pleistocene sedimentary carbonates, deposited in subtidal reef to supratidal dune environments, also form an important aspect of the geology of the island and are more extensive on Oahu than on any other of the main Hawaiian islands.\\n\\nOahu has, in the past, been characterized as a \"stable tectonic setting\" and suitable for use as a global datum for Quaternary sea levels (e.g., Veeh 1966; Ku et al. 1974; Stearns 1978; Moore 1987). However, geophysical investigations (Watts and ten Brink 1989) and analyses of Pleistocene limestones on Oahu indicate that the island has been undergoing gradual uplift during the late Quaternary attributed to lithospheric flexure associated with volcanic loading at the Big Island of Hawaii. Elevations and ages of emergent Pleistocene limestones on Oahu indicate that Oahu has experienced nearly 30 m of uplift since 500 ka at an average rate of 0.05 to 0.06 m per 1000 years.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe island of Oahu has been important in late Quaternary sea-level studies (e.g., Veeh 1966; Ku et al. 1974). Oahu contains an extensive and complex sedimentary carbonate record in the form of emerged and submerged shorelines (preserved intertidal notches) and shelves (coral and coralline algal reef complexes). Sedimentologic and petrologic data are an integral component of paleoenvironmental studies, and thus paleo-sea-level interpretations. However, there have been few sedimentary petrologic studies of uplifted carbonates in Hawaii (e.g., Meyers 1987; Sherman et al. 1993). In addition, the nearshore submarine record has received very limited study.\\n\\nMETHODS AND NOMENCLATURE\\n\\nCores were collected via a diver-operated Tech 2000 submersible, hydraulic, rotary coring drill with a 7.6 cm diameter diamond-studded drill.\\n\\nRESEARCH.

Recovered cores averaged 62 cm in length, with a maximum of 205 cm. The percentage of recovery averaged 90%. Limestones were classified according to Dunham\\'s (1962) scheme as modified by Embry and Klovan (1971).\\n\\nThe cores were sampled for radiometric, petrographic, mineralogic, and geochemical analyses, taking care that each lithofacies as well as obvious diagenetic features within a core were sampled. Approximately 50 thin sections were analyzed petrographically. Terminology for describing microfabrics follows the recommendations of Rezak and Lavoie (1993).\\n\\nDuplicates were made of a portion of the thin sections for staining for Mg calcite following the method of Choquette and Trusell (1978).\\n\\nCarbonate mineralogy was determined with a Scintag Pad V powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with a solid-state Ge detector using Cu Ka radiation. Calcite-to-aragonite composition ratios were determined using a standard curve generated from the peak area ratios of known mixtures of aragonite and calcite (Sabine 1992).\\n\\nThe mole percentages of MgCO3 of magnesian calcite phases were determined from the offset of the d spacing of the 104 Mg calcite peak from the d spacing of the 104 peak of pure calcite (Bischoff et al. 1983). The term magnesian calcite or Mg calcite refers to those metastable calcites with greater than 5 mole % MgCO3. Calcite with less than 5 mole % MgCO3 is simply referred to as calcite (cf. Scoffin 1987). All mineralogic data represent the average of two duplicate analyses.\\n\\nMajor and minor elements (Ca, Mg, Sr, Fe, Mn) in components and cements were quantitatively measured with a Cameca SX50 electron microprobe. Parameter settings were: 5 μm beam diameter, 15 kV accelerator voltage, and 15 nA beam current, counting times 60 s (peak and background) for Mg, Sr, Fe, and Mn. 30 s (peak) and 15 s (background) for Ca. In all cases, Mn was below detection limits and, therefore, not reported here. With the exception of some microcrystalline cements, Fe was reported here.\\n\\nFACIES\\n\\nMassive-Coral Facies\\n\\nThe massive-coral facies (Fig. 4) consists of ill sill coral and coralline-algal framework along with coarse skeletal grainstones and rudstones that\\n---\\n## DIAGENESIS OF PLEISTOCENE CARBONATES\\n\\n|zone|zone|zone 3|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|zone 1|zone 2|zone 3|\\n\\nBranching-coral facies - Massive-coral facies\\n\\nBranching-coral facies - Massive-coral facies\\n\\nSea level\\n\\n10m Pleistocene subaerial - Sea level\\n\\n-10m Pleistocene subaerial exposure surface\\n\\n20m Kaneohe Shoreline\\n\\nKaneohe Shoreline\\n\\n-30m\\n\\n|Floatstone| | |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Bafflestone|Floatstone| |\\n|Bafflestone| | |\\n|Bindstone| | |\\n|Audstone|Framestone|Bindstone|\\n\\n|Sample|Age|\\n|---|---|\\n|5-151|223.3 (ka)|\\n|5-152|247.2 (ka)|\\n|3-154|279.3 (ka)|\\n|3-155|279.7 (ka)|\\n|6-151|82.8 (ka)|\\n\\n|Calcite| | |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Aragonite|Mg Calcite| |\\n|Aragonite|Mg Calcite| |\\n\\n|Sample|Age|\\n|---|---|\\n|8-3S1A|96.8|\\n|6-151|82.8|\\n\\nSchematic profile of nearshore terrace\\n\\nFIG. 1 - Schematic profile of nearshore terrace showing relative locations of zones 1, 2, and 3.\\n\\nTOP) Zonation of lithofacies along terrace\\n\\nMIDDLE) Ages and initial values of fossil corals MAl samples are from zone 2.

Data is corrected for procedural blanks (6 Pi each for Th and U). Reported errors include both analytical error and true value errors.\\n\\nIf \"U = 1.000\" activity is equal to 1.000 activity relative to 238U.\\n\\nThe predominant corals are massive colonies of Porites lobata, a coral that is most common on wave-exposed reef slopes between depths of 3 and 15 m (Maragos 1977). Crustose coralline algae are also an important component of the massive-coral facies where they occur as sheet-like encrustations on the upper surfaces of corals, lining voids in the coral framework, over previously lithified rudstone, as well as coating larger coral clasts in the rudstones. The encrusting foraminifer Homotrema is also common. Vermetid gastropods and serpulid worms are present but rare. Associated skeletal grainstones and rudstones are composed predominantly of fragments of the framework-forming corals and coralline algae, as well as reef-associated organisms, such as mollusks, echinoderms, and benthic foraminifers. Grains typically range from medium sand through coarse pebbles and are subangular to subrounded, exhibiting poor to moderate sorting. Large clasts are generally encrusted by coralline algae. Mud is also present but is restricted to protected voids in the framework.\\n\\nThe branching-coral facies is composed of delicate branching corals, coralline algae, and associated biota set in a lime-mud matrix forming in situ bafflestones, floatstones, or wackestones. It is differentiated from the massive-coral facies by its mud-supported fabric and the presence of delicate branching corals, such as Pocillopora damicomis. In Hawaii, this coral is usually found in protected bays or upon the inner parts of large reef flats away from breaking waves (Maragos 1977). The floatstones and wackestones are generally poorly sorted and contain silt- to pebble-size, angular skeletal clasts, as well as subangular to subrounded peloids, supported by a lime-mud matrix. Grains constitute 10-20% of these lime-mud-supported bafflestones, floatstones, or wackestones. Skeletal grains are predominantly fragments of branching corals and coralline algae, but also include mollusks, foraminifers, and echinoderms. Preservation of skeletal components varies from poor to good. Boring, micritization, and micrite envelopes are common. Sand-size peloids, which constitute 20% of the grains in this facies, probably represent micritized skeletal grains. Branching corals and coralline algae are also found in an upright growth position and may have acted as \"baffles\" trapping fine-grained sediment and forming in situ bafflestones. The presence of delicate branching corals and dominance of lime-mud matrix indicate a low-energy environment of deposition. The branching-coral facies is found in zone I, along the inner part of the terrace landward of the massive-coral facies. The distribution of the branching-coral facies is consistent with the expected zonation of lithofacies in a marginal reef complex, where bafflestones, floatstones, or wackestones are most common in reef flat, reef crest, and reef front environments (cf. James and Bourque 1992).\\n\\nThe combination of a grainstone and rudstone matrix with in situ framework is also common in high-energy settings (cf. Bosence 1985). The massive-coral facies is found in zones 2 and 3, i.e., along the seaward margin of the terrace. This distribution is consistent with expected zonation of lithofacies in a marginal reef complex, where rudstones and framestones are most common in reef flat, reef crest, and reef front environments (cf. James and Bourque 1992). The most stringent test of age reliability arises from a comparison of the Th/U age-corrected 234U/238U (or 230Th/234U) with that of modern seawater (activity ratios in modern seawater range from 1.146 to 1.150, or 146 to 150%). Modern and Holocene-age corals have 234U/238U of 145 to 155% (Bard et al. 1996a; Bard et al. 1996b, and references therein). On the basis of these results, 234U/238U has been accepted as a \"working definition\" of Th/U age quality, with samples having Th/U ranging from 145 to 150% being considered highly reliable, those with Th/U ranging from 150 to 160 or 165% being moderately reliable, and those in excess of 165% being significantly less reliable (e.g., Szabo et al. 1994; Bard et al. 1996b). Although only three of the six corals in the present data set rigorously conform to the \"acceptable category\" as just defined (samples WAI6-1SI, WAI8-3SIA, and MAI5-IS1), one additional sample (MAI5-IS2) is barely outside this range, considering its stage 7 age. The other two (pre-stage 7) samples, both from core MAI3-1, have clearly compromised Th/U on any measurement scale. Both of these samples contained < 3% calcite, indicating that replacement of original coral aragonite by calcite has been negligible. Therefore, possible addition of more recent submarine aragonitic cements may explain the elevated Th/U values.\\n\\nUsing the four most reliable ages of the present data set, the following chronological history can be reconstructed: The upper part of the terrace (zone 2) is constructed of materials aged 223.1 ka (highly reliable) to 247.0 ka.\\n---\\n## DIAGENESIS OF PLEISTOCENE CARBONATES\\n\\n|content|page number|\\n|---|---|\\n|DIAGENESIS OF PLEISTOCENE CARBONATES|1087|\\n|DIAGENESIS OF PLEISTOCENE CARBONATES|1087|\\n\\n200 100 ka Fragments: Acicular aragonite absent from the branching-coral facies of zone Overall; it is not an important agent of lithification in the submerged Pleistocene limestones of Oahu: These acicular aragonite cements have an average strontium concentration of 7891 pgg MgCO; content consistently low, averaging 0.4 mole MgCO. The high strontium and low magnesium concentrations found in the acicular aragonite cements are typical of aragonite cements precipitated from normal seawater (Macintyre 1977; Macintyre and Marshall 1988). When multiple generations of cement are present in intraskeletal pores in coral skeletons, syntaxial acicular aragonite is the first cement, a common relationship that has been reported at several locales (cf. Ginsburg et al, 1971; James et al. 1976). Macintyre (1977) and Lighty (1985) observed that syntaxial acicular aragonite forms just below the living tissue and surface of active skeletal accretion in corals. They concluded that its formation is probably contemporaneous with coral growth. Thus, the presence of syntaxial acicular aragonite in the massive-coral facies provides good evidence of early marine diagenesis contemporaneous with deposition.

The crusts are found in laminated and columnar forms. Laminated crusts generally have a smooth surface, display wavy, often discontinuous laminae 0.5 to 1.0 mm thick, and may have a domal shape. Columnar crusts have an irregular, \"knobby\" surface, which is the expression of club-shaped protuberances 3 to 30 mm high. The knobs may be a result of the differential accretion of microcrystalline or peloidal Mg calcite or in some cases the presence of buried encrusting organisms (e.g., Macintyre 1977, 1984; Marshall 1983). In some instances columnar crusts may form on top of laminated crusts. In modern environments, micritic crusts develop within reef structures, generally in areas close to the reef surface and where marine cementation is particularly active (Macintyre and Marshall 1988; Scoffin 1993). The micritic crusts found in the Oahu cores contain an average of 15.0 mole % MgCO and 1321 pglg strontium.\\n\\n## MINERALOGIC COMPOSITION OF PLEISTOCENE CARBONATES\\n\\n|content|page number|\\n|---|---|\\n|MINERALOGIC COMPOSITION OF PLEISTOCENE CARBONATES| |\\n\\nThe submerged Pleistocene carbonates of Oahu have a variable composition of aragonite, Mg calcite, and calcite. A few samples contained trace amounts of dolomite, but it is relatively unimportant compared to the other carbonate minerals. Although the average bulk mineralogic compositions of limestones in all three zones include calcite, aragonite, and Mg calcite, there is a general trend of decreasing calcite content from zone 1 to zone 3. Zone 1 limestones have a relatively uniform composition of predominantly calcite (> 60%). Limestones in zone 2 have the broadest range of compositions from uniformly calcite to a mixture of mainly aragonite and Mg calcite. Limestones in zone 3 display a more uniform composition predominantly of aragonite and Mg calcite.\\n\\n## DIAGENETIC PROCESS AND PRODUCTS\\n\\nEvidence of early shallow-marine diagenesis is found in first-generation shallow-marine aragonite and Mg calcite cements. Aragonite is found exclusively as acicular aggregates, whereas Mg calcite is found in a variety of forms, including microcrystalline, peloidal, and bladed spar. All are common shallow-marine reef cements. Acicular aragonite cement is relatively common in the massive-coral facies of zones 2 and 3, but is found exclusively as an intra-skeletal syntaxial cement mainly in coral and less frequently in mollusk. Along with micrite and peloids, bladed microspar and spar is a common cement in the submerged limestones of Oahu. It is found as isopachous.\\n\\n## Shallow-Marine Early Diagenesis\\n\\nEvidence of early shallow-marine diagenesis is found in first-generation shallow-marine aragonite and Mg calcite cements.

Aragonitic mollusk and coral grains are preferentially dissolved, leaving behind moldic pores. On a macroscopic scale these external molds retain an impression of the surface form of the dissolved coral or mollusk. In some cases a mollusk shell has been filled by lime mud that became lithified. Later, the mollusk dissolved away, leaving behind a steinkern (internal cast).

This event is then followed by the gradual disappearance of aragonite and replacement by calcite. It has been demonstrated that both of these meteoric diagenetic events have taken place in the zones 1 and 2 limestones. The last-generation Mg calcite cements contain an average of 15 mole % MgCO. Experimental data indicate that magnesian calcite cements and internal sediments appear to be in pristine condition, i.e., they have retained uniform high-magnesium contents and show no\\n---\\nCE SHERMAN ET AL 1092 C.E.

The broad range of ages found indicate the complexity of the internal structure of the terrace, reflecting stages of accretion during several interglacial high-stands. We suggest that most of the terrace is composed of an ill situ stage reef complex.\\n\\n### DISCUSSION\\n\\nAlthough Quaternary carbonates form an important component of the subaerial and nearshore geology of Oahu, relatively little is known about the timing and nature of formation of much of this record. Deep cores taken on the Ewa Plain (Stearns and Chamberlain 1967) contain a record of at least eight transgressive/regressive cycles (Resig 1969). These cycles, however, have never been fully correlated with the marine oxygen isotope record. Emerged limestones such as the Waimanalo Formation, which reaches elevations as high as +12.5 m, have been correlated with marine oxygen isotope substage 5e (Ku et al. 1974; Szabo et al. 1994). The Kaena Formation, reaching +30 m, has been correlated with marine oxygen isotope stages 13 or 15 (Szabo et al. 1994). A record of Holocene reef growth in Hanauma Bay was described by Easton and Olson (1976). Emerged Holocene marine deposits have been described by Fletcher and Jones (1996). This represents our state of knowledge of Quaternary carbonate deposition on Oahu. Thus, a large part of the Quaternary has not been clearly identified in the stratigraphy of Oahu, namely the periods between deposition of the Kaena and Waimanalo Formations.\\n\\n500 ka to 125 ka, including marine oxygen isotope stages II, 9, and 7), and the Waimanalo Formation and Holocene deposits (-125 ka to -7 ka, including marine oxygen isotope stages 5c, 5a, and 3). Cores taken at Waimanalo (Lum and Stearns 1970) indicate that a thick, subaerial eolianite separates the Kaena and Waimanalo Formations. At Barbers Point an unconformity spanning perhaps 400 thousand years separates these units (Sherman et al. 1993).\\n\\n|Th-U ages|Location|\\n|---|---|\\n|Fossil corals from the nearshore terrace of Oahu|Indicate a lack of early marine cementation and dominance of micritization in the branching-coral facies consistent with its deposition in a low-energy back-reef environment.

There is no conclusive evidence that these limestones were exposed to a meteoric phreatic environment. Although the limestones likely underwent two complete cycles of emergence and submergence, multiple generations of meteoric cements were not observed. The diagenetic record in these limestones appears to be incomplete.\\n\\nPost-meteoric marine cementation in the branching-coral facies is more extensive than early marine cementation. This implies a change in diagenetic environment from stagnant marine phreatic during deposition of the branching-coral facies to the present active marine phreatic environment favoring marine cementation.\\n\\nUpon submergence into the marine environment, it appears that the stable, lithified substrate along with conduit or channel-type porosity has led to high flow rates induced by channelized seawater. This, in turn, resulted in precipitation of thick isopachous rims of bladed Mg calcite lining the walls of large voids.\\n\\nThe general trend of decreasing mineralogic stabilization from zones 1 through 3 is consistent with the Th-U ages of fossil corals from these deposits, indicating less mineralogic stabilization in the younger limestones.\\n\\nConclusions: All limestones found in cores from a nearshore terrace on Oahu are typical of shallow-marine reef environments and comprise either branching-coral or massive-coral facies. The shoreward zonation of facies and stages of marine isotope stage are shown in the relationship between late Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, terrace formation/reef accretion, and stages of marine meteoric diagenesis.\\n---\\n## CE SHERMAN ET AL\\n\\nDollar, S.J. and Tribble, G.W. 1993.
